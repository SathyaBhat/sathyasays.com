Thanks to the Nairobi AWS User Group for having me over. In this talk, I brief on what infrastructure as code (IaC) is, the options available for IaC and then do a deep dive into the AWS CDK. 

There's also a demo on how to install, get started with CDK and some sample code for creating an S3 bucket, a Fargate task and VPC & ASG stack. The slides are published online on my [website](https://slides.sathyasays.com/aws-fargate-ec2). 

The source code for the slides and demo is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/SathyaBhat/talks-slides/tree/main/infra-as-code-awsug-nairobi).
