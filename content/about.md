Hi, I’m Sathyajith Bhat (aka “SJ”/“SathyaBhat”/“coolpcguy”/“cpg”). I handle DevOps at [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/)</a>, on [Adobe I/O](https://adobe.io)</a>, the author of [Practical Docker with Python: Build, Release and Distribute Your Python App with Docker](https://u.sbhat.me/practical-docker-book) published by [Apress Media](https://u.sbhat.me/practical-docker) and an [AWS Community Hero](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/sathyajith-bhat/). Prior to this, I brought in DevOps practices at [Styletag](http://styletag.com/).


In my free time, I am part of the <a href="http://barcampbangalore.org/bcb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barcamp Bangalore</a> planning team, handling devops and social media for BCB. I’m also a volunteer Community Moderator at <a href="http://superuser.com/users/4377/sathya" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super User</a> and <a href="http://webapps.stackexchange.com/users/310/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Apps Stack Exchange</a>, Administrator for [Indian Video Gamer forums][1] and previously have been a Moderator for Chip-India and Tech 2 forums.

Besides SQL, PL/SQL & Oracle Forms, I also know a little bit of Ruby, Python. I love listening to music and usually seen playing video games(most played genres include A/RPGs, Racing and City builders).
