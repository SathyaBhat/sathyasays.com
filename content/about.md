### Bio 

I am an experienced Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) with over 15 years of experience in DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering, System Architecture, Performance Tuning, Infrastructure setup, DBA, Data Conversion and Observability.  I'm not fanatic about specific tools or services and believe in making the most available out of the tools that I get to work with. I have significant experience and proficient in the below services, tools and technologies:

Cloud Platforms
* AWS, Azure, Alibaba Cloud

Containers & Orchestration
* Docker, Kubernetes

Infrastructure as Code
* Terraform, AWS CDK

Configuation Management
* Ansible, Chef

Observability
* Prometheus, New Relic, Sumo Logic, Splunk, Datadog

I am the author of Practical Docker with Python ([first](https://amzn.to/3B9pQaz) & [second edition](https://amzn.to/3B9pQaz)), a co-author of [The CDK Book](https://www.thecdkbook.com/). I work with a lot of different communities  and have been recognized as an [AWS Container Hero](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/sathyajith-bhat/). 

I love organizing and running events (physical as well as virtual) and have been part of organizing committee of events such as Barcamp Bangalore, AWS Community Day - Bangalore, India, South Asia, and CDK Day. In my free time I love playing games on my PC and/or Switch (typically ARPGs/City Builders/Simulators) and occasionally livestream gaming and coding on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/sathyabhat).
