It seems the past year has been the season of re-invention of menus. The traditional KDE style menu was majorly redesigned and revamped to give the Slab aka Kickoff menu.

The next style of menus comes from <a href="https://code.google.com/u/@WBRfRFVXDhdHXgU%3D/" target="_blank">Cole Anste</a>, who&#8217;s put forward and implemented his version of Don Hopkin&#8217;s version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_menu" target="_blank">Pie Menu</a>.

The radial menu reminds me a lot of the radial menu present in Neverwinter Nights, I must say.

So if you&#8217;re eager to get this thing installed via SVN, just head over to [Google Code page][1] and follow the instructions.

Debian users can get the .deb file from [here][2].
