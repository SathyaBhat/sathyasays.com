  These three short videos &#8212; all less than 8 minutes long &#8212; give you an idea of Fedora 8&#8217;s &#8220;look and feel&#8221; during the installation and setup process, and show you what software is installed by default. The third video shows you how to install and &#8212; just as important &#8212; <em>uninstall</em> software in Fedora 8.

Fedora is often described as a GNU/Linux distribution &#8220;for enthusiasts and developers.&#8221; It is sponsored by Red Hat, and some people see Fedora as the &#8220;beta&#8221; version of Red Hat&#8217;s official releases.
