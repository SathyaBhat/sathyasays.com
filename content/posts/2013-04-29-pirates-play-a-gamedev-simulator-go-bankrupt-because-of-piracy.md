  <ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 130%;">
      When Game Dev Tycoon (a Game Development Simulation Game) was released, its developer released a cracked version on BitTorrent simultaneously.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 130%;">
      After a certain point in the game, the cracked version would prevent the player from generating simulated revenue due to simulated piracy.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 130%;">
      Many comments of people using the cracked version arrived on forums asking why their game would not take off and how to get rid of simulated piracy in the game.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 130%;">
      Analysis of the usage shows that 214 genuine version where used/purchased against 3104 cracked version (93.6%)
    </li>
  </ul>
