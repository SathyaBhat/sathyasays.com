I&#8217;ve mentioned previous why it&#8217;s a bad idea to re use passwords. And it&#8217;s come to <a href="http://techie-buzz.com/gmail/how-playstation-network-attack-password-reuse-and-unmonitored-account-resulted-in-mass-phishing.html" target="_blank">bite me long after getting</a> rid of the habit.

I recommend <a href="http://lastpass.com/" target="_blank">LastPass</a>. Even better, <a href="https://lastpass.com/features_joinpremium.php" target="_blank">LastPass Premium</a>. It&#8217;s worth the cost and even more so. And don&#8217;t forget to enable <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/04/make-your-email-hacker-proof.html" target="_blank">2-factor auth on your Google Account</a>.
