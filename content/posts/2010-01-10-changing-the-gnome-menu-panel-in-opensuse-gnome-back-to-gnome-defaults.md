Seems like lot of openSUSE Gnome users don&#8217;t like the new Gnome panel, which is radically different interface from the traditional Menu bar with Applications/Places/System entries. Personally I prefer the new style, perhaps because I&#8217;m used to the openSUSE Kickoff panel, and I really dig the search feature

You can go back to the default Applications / Places / System panel pretty easily. To do this:

  * Right click the bottom panel and choose add a panel
  * Now right click the top panel and choose Add to Panel
  * In the search input box type &#8220;menu&#8221;, and you will see about six entries, one of which is &#8220;Traditional main Menu&#8221;
  * Add the menu to the panel, move it to where you like, and delete the &#8220;original&#8221; menu.

And, you&#8217;re done!
