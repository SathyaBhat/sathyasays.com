A [german publication][1] has posted an interview with Todd Hollenshead, id Software&#8217;s CEO, that reveals id Software and John Carmack are no longer as committed to Linux as they have been. Todd&#8217;s words also imply that the Windows version of id Software&#8217;s next game, Rage, will use Direct3D rather than OpenGL.

Id Tech 5, id Software&#8217;s new engine, was first publicly shown at this year&#8217;s Apple WWDC event running on a Mac. Their previous engine, DOOM 3, was also first shown on Mac hardware. At E3 id Software announced their next game, Rage, would have a simultaneous PC/Mac/XBOX 360/PS3 release and that it would run at 60 fps.

In this interview Todd mentions that a Linux version of id Tech 5 is not planned; he also goes on to mention that John Carmack is no longer as interested in Linux and that Rage will be a DX9 game, not DX10, and will run on Windows XP. Despite this, the game will ship for the Mac using OpenGL.

The Golem.de reporters were able to [see][2] the game running on all four platforms the game will ship in (from the left: Mac, PC, PS3 and XBOX 360) and they were all purportedly running at 60 frames per second at 720p resolution. In that photograph it&#8217;s visible that the PC also has a XBOX 360 controller plugged-in.
