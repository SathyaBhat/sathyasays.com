</p>

The purpose of the Light Edition is to bring a version of Linux Mint which doesn&#8217;t contain:

  * proprietary software
  * patented technologies
  * support for restricted formats

In some countries where the legislation allows software patents to be enforced the Light Edition provides a way for users to legally download Linux Mint.

The following components are not present in this Light Edition:

  * Macromedia Flash
  * Support for encrypted DVDs
  * Windows codecs
  * Support for restricted multimedia formats
  * Unrar
  * Sun Java (replaced by GIJ)

This edition includes all other technologies from Celena and among them: mintAssistant and mintUpload.

Note: You can transform Linux Mint &#8220;Light Edition&#8221; into Linux Mint &#8220;Main Edition&#8221; by installing &#8220;[Multimedia Support][3]&#8221; once the system is installed on your computer.
