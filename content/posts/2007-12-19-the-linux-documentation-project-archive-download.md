LDP is a loosely knit team of volunteers who provide documentation for many aspects of Linux. There are several forms of documentation: Guides, HOWTOs, man pages, and FAQs.  
You can browse it at <https://tldp.org/>

A member of Mangalore LUG, [Dr. Neville][1] has uploaded this and was kind enough allow me to post the links here, so all credits to him.
