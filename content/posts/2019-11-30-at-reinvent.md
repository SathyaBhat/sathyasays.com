I've always dreamed of being at reInvent and this year, not only do I get to be at re:Invent, I also get a chance to lead a Dev Chat.
I'm really excited to be there, to present and more importantly, to meet and interact with other [AWS Heroes](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/?community-heroes-all.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortPosition&community-heroes-all.sort-order=asc) and re:Invent participants.

Last year, I was honoured to [being named](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-aws-machine-learning-heroes-plus-new-aws-community-heroes/) as one of the [Community Heroes](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/sathyajith-bhat/) and almost made it to re:Invent 2018. However, due to some delays in visa renewal, I could not make it on time.

A lot has happened since then and I am happy to make it to this year's re:Invent.

re:Invent is no doubt crazy with [thousands of sessions](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/learn/session_catalog/) spanning multiple venues - obviously, it is not possible to be present for all.

However, if you do plan to drop by for the [Dev Chat](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=99680&csrftkn=ODOV-XY0F-PLM9-T18O-SZUU-CE6U-SKV8-NP6X) or for [Taco Tuesday with AWS Heroes](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=101954&csrftkn=588O-AALQ-JVA6-9Y8B-AVFV-05JL-HMU1-AEWB), would love to talk to you!

Have a good re:Invent and see you then!
