By now, you must&#8217;ve heard of Ubiquity. If not, well read on! 

<link rel="commands" href="http://sathyasays.com/wp-content/lincr.js" name="Lincr It!" />
Ubiquity is an add-on to Mozilla&#8217;s extremely popular Firefox browser. Ubiquity allows you to do things &#8211; say search for something, get the latest weather updates,  book reviews, so on and so forth, just by typing the commands into the Ubiquity input box &#8211; rather than by going over to address bar, typing the URL for each individual site, etc. Now most people fear by the word &#8211; &#8220;commands&#8221; &#8211; OHHH! will it be cryptic, confusing? Well, NO! Rather than me explaining, just have a look at video above

 

I use Lincr a LOT &#8211; for the uninitiated, [Lincr][1] is a URL shortening service, by Aalaap. So why Lincr? Well TinyURLs are no longer tiny, Lincr&#8217;d URLs are, and hey &#8211; the name&#8217;s catchy! 

Anyways, I use the Lincr bookmarklet prettty often, and while trying out Ubiquity I thought why not try it out for Lincr, and bingo, here you go! If you&#8217;re using Ubiquity, you should get a prompt asking if you want to subscribe to Ubiquity command. Accept if you want to :)

If you wish to Lincr, just hit Ubiquity shortcut key, and type `lincr (<url to be lincr'd> )`.

So if you find this useful just subscribe to it, and drop a comment here!
