This is a guest post by Aditya.

Most anime watchers who download anime must be knowing what styled subs are but for those who don&#8217;t know styled subs are special type of subtitles which have different fonts. The picture below demonstrates why exactly styled subs are needed.
  
Here&#8217;s a picture to show a particular video with styled subs disabled
  
<a href="http://cooladi2.pictiger.com/images/15842894/" target="_blank"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/img6.pictiger.com/60c/15842894_th.jpg?w=740" border="0" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
  
Here&#8217;s the same one with styled subs enabled
  
<img class="alignnone" src="https://i0.wp.com/img2.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/8f1e5c86c8.png?w=740" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />
  
Now in the next to images notice the position of the word [Fail]
  
<a href="http://cooladi2.pictiger.com/albums/30642/15838744/" target="_blank"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/img6.pictiger.com/a5e/15838744_th.jpg?w=740" border="0" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

<a href="http://cooladi2.pictiger.com/albums/30642/15838743/" target="_blank"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/img6.pictiger.com/0b7/15838743_th.jpg?w=740" border="0" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
  
In the first one the word[Fail] is at the bottom and is white in color , while in the second one when styled subs are enabled it is displayed right under the Japanese word for fail and is black in color
  
Here&#8217;s the perfect demonstration of styled sub in windows media player classic with vobsub filter
  
<a href="http://cooladi2.pictiger.com/images/15838771/" target="_blank"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/img6.pictiger.com/749/15838771_th.jpg?w=740" border="0" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
  
Here is the same picture in Mplayer without styled subs
  
<a href="http://cooladi2.pictiger.com/images/15838767/" target="_blank"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/img6.pictiger.com/d07/15838767_th.jpg?w=740" border="0" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
  
Here is the same picture of Mplayer with styled subs
  
<img class="alignnone" src="https://i2.wp.com/img2.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/fac4af6209.png?w=740" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />
  
Note that it still isn&#8217;t completely perfect but it is almost there

**Getting Styled subs to work**
  
Now the best player for these kind of files is SMplayer. Even mplayer does the job.
  
You can get them from the following places
  
[Smplayer][1]
  
[Mplayer][2]
  
After downloading SMplayer or Mplayer right click at any part of the player and select preferences(or you can hit Ctrl+P for SMplayer). Now go to subtitles settings, for SMplayer select SSA/ASS Library tab and select use SSA/ASS library, for mplayerunser subtitles & OSD tab select SSA/ASS subtitle rendering.
  
Here the pictures of the preferences of mplayes and smplayer respectively
  
<a href="http://cooladi2.pictiger.com/albums/30642/15838741/" target="_blank"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/img6.pictiger.com/474/15838741_th.jpg?w=740" border="0" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

<a href="http://cooladi2.pictiger.com/albums/30642/15838742/" target="_blank"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/img6.pictiger.com/4b6/15838742_th.jpg?w=740" border="0" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
  
Now load the file you want to play and enjoy!
  
Note: For Mplayer each time you load it you have to select channel 0 for subtitles.
