A quickie:

I wanted to change the default application from Banshee/Totem for my media files to VLC ( since I didn&#8217;t have proprietary codecs installed, and VLC does). Searched all of YaST/Settings and couldn&#8217;t find where to change the default application.

<!--more-->The solution was pretty simple, just right click the file(type), click on Properties,Â  and Open-With tab

Just choose the default application, or click on Add and select VLC, and you&#8217;re done!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853" title="File / Properties / Open With / VLC" src="https://sathyasays.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/properties-openwith-vlc.png" alt="File / Properties / Open With / VLC"   />

Simple. Still wish there was a central place from where I could update it though.
