While the UT3 Demo for Windows is available sine a few days, the linux client is not yet ready. Nevertheless a beta version of the linux server is now available as [icculus][1] (Ryan C. Gordon) states in his [blog][2]. The blog also includes the link to a [mailing-list entry][3] with more detailed information about downloading and running the server. Also new mirrors would be welcome.
