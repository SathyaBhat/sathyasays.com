Recently, Adobe had released the beta version of Adobe Integrated Runtime, more commonly known as AIR, for Linux. While this is indeed good news, unfortunately it isn’t available via repositories, meaning you’ll have to download the binaries, set the permissions and install it by launching via command prompt. While this seems pretty complicated, its not really.

Let me show you how to go about installing Adobe AIR and AIR applications on your Linux box.

<!--more--></p> 

  1. Download the installer .bin file from <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/air_linux.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
  2. Next, navigate to where you had downloaded and saved the file. Right click on it, click properties, and ensure that executable is checked.

  3. .Next, open the terminal and cd to where you had saved the file to. For eg, if you had saved the file in a directory called Downloads in your home directory, just type `cd ~/Downloads`

  4. Next, run the bin file by typing `./name-of-downloaded-file`. So if the name of the downloaded file is adobeair\_linux\_b1_091508.bin then type `./adobeair_linux_b1_091508.bin`

  5. You will get an installation screen, just follow the dialog boxes.

  6. That’s it! You’ve installed AIR! 

  7. If you want to install AIR applications, just download the .air files, and double click on them, they will be executed under AIR.
