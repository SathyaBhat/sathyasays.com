WordPress today released the first beta of WordPress 2.7 as on schedule. However the fianl release of WordPress 2.7 won&#8217;t be available on November 10, as per the schedule.

As posted on the WordPress development blog

> Speaking of the final release, it will not be available on November 10th as originally scheduled.  We are two weeks behind schedule at the moment.  We need a little more time to finish the visual design, do a round of user testing against that finished design, and do a proper round of public beta testing

However they mention that they release a Release Candidate on November 10th, and that it would be a very polished, release-worthy version.
  
I&#8217;ve been checking it out, and looks pretty impressive indeed.
