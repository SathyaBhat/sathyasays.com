<span>Much like most of <span>Google&#8217;s</span> projects Google Chrome was launched all of a sudden yesterday. Though it was &#8220;discovered&#8221; rather &#8220;accidentally&#8221; by one a Google insider hitting the send button containing the comic-book type images of Google Chrome&#8217;s workings(excuse me, a Google guy hitting the &#8220;Send&#8221; button accidentally? Yeah,right! (<span>Santosh</span> agrees with me too on this one). And the hype was unprecedented. Once the hype died down and everyone got to try &#8211; the impressions were rather more or less universal, mainly being</span>

 

  * <span>Its <span>frikking</span> fast</span>
  * Its too basic
  * <span>Chrome aims IE <span>userbase</span> rather than <span>Firefox</span></span>
  * <span>Unless <span>addons</span> are brought in, most <span>Firefox</span> users would not switch to Chrome.</span>

<div>
  <span>  Google Chrome is basically the best of <span>Firefox</span>, Opera, <span>Konqueror</span>, Safari and Internet Explorer all rolled into 1. You have the benefit of rendering engine &#8211; <span>WebKit</span> which powers Safari and K<span>onqueror</span>(since <span>Webkit</span> is a fork of KHTML which powers Konqueror), you have the equivalent of Internet Explorer&#8217;s <span>InPrivate</span> mode, Opera&#8217;s speed dial-like homepage, and <span>Firefox&#8217;s</span> <span>addon</span> capability(though not there at the moment).</span>
</div>

<div>
  Now what&#8217;s my take ?
</div>

<div>
  <span>Well for one, the homepage is similar yet different from Opera&#8217;s speed dial. Unlike Opera&#8217;s Speed  Dial which requires you to manually set the web pages, Chrome does so automatically based on which pages you most frequently visit &#8211;  One step better than Mozilla <span>Firefox&#8217;s</span> Most visited button.</span>
</div>

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span>You can also search through your history pages, or open your recently closed tab pages right from the home page(Incidentally, it also shares <span>Firefox&#8217;s</span> shortcut for Reopening the recently closed tab &#8211; just hit <span>Ctrl</span> + Shift + T) and bingo!</span>
</p>

<div>
  <span>I did like the UI &#8211; its plain, simple, and free from clutter &#8211; gives me maximum space for my web viewing purposes. Just have a look at the pic below &#8211; no irritation menu bars or huge buttons (thought the omission of stop button is unforgivable).</span>
</div>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sathyabhat/2828697754/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3090/2828697754_7dc3705799_m.jpg" alt="Chrome - Full " /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
   
</p>

<div>
  <span>I also like the way the just 2 buttons which are placed next to address bar &#8211; these 2 allow you to configure most of Chrome&#8217;s options, and have links for openings new tabs, new windows, and the Incognito mode &#8211; which, like <span>IE&#8217;s</span> <span>InPrivate</span> mode, doesn&#8217;t store history, cookies etc of the sites visited under this mode.</span>
</div>

<div>
  Then there are also some neat touches that I like 
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span>Re-sizable text boxes. &#8211; Unlike most browsers, Chrome gives you an option to <span>resize</span> the text boxes &#8211; perfect if you want to type some especially long sentences &#8211; say an address probably, but the default width provided was too less. Just hold and drag the handle the edge of the text box and <span>resize</span></span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span><span>Popup</span> status bar at the bottom &#8211; Again, unlike most browsers, you don&#8217;t have a fixed size status bar, eating away real estate. The status bar pops <span>unintrusively</span> while the page loads and then disappears. It again pops up while hovering over a link &#8211; real smooth!</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>Chrome is <span>frikking</span> fast &#8211; whether on pages which heavily use JavaScript or not &#8211; I suspect its because, like Opera, the <span>WebKit</span> rendering engine grabs and displays text first, images later &#8211; this is especially obvious if you&#8217;re using a slow connection like I am</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>Chrome seems to be localized to specific countries &#8211; For example in the Manage search engine page, Chrome offers me, in the list Choices of MSN India, <span>Guruji</span>, Yahoo! India and <span>Rediff</span></span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sathyabhat/2828816522/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3123/2828816522_362b7f1222_m.jpg" alt="Search Engines" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      The whole moving tab-thingy is neat! You can detach a tab from a window, and it becomes a separate window! Similarly, moving a lone window to an existing Chrome window attaches it as a tab!
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sathyabhat/2828695746/" target="_blank"> <img style="text-decoration: underline;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3239/2828695746_634554ce1f_m.jpg" alt="Tabs" /> <span style="color: #000000;"> </span></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sathyabhat/2827800741/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3150/2827800741_90d9a97c14_m.jpg" alt="Tabs detached" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
     
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span>Chrome comes with its own task manager! You can kill any tab, or <span>plugin</span>. And as its been mentioned, every tab is a new process and hence even if 1 tab freezes, it doesn&#8217;t take down the entire browser &#8211; though Chrome hasn&#8217;t crashed at all for me.</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
    Google Chrome is still in beta(the version number is 0.2.149.27) and it shows &#8211; there are several drawbacks:
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>One of the MOST CRITICAL drawback, <span>atleast</span> for me is the lack of RSS support &#8211; RSS is the killer, I use <span>Firefox&#8217;s</span> Live Bookmarks extensively, and can&#8217;t live without it. Is this <span>Google&#8217;s</span> way of telling we won&#8217;t give you an RSS reader, use Google Reader if you want ? Though I _do_ use Google Reader extensively, I would also prefer something like live bookmarks</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>No <span>Addons</span>/extensions as now, but hey, it&#8217;s still early days</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Some pages don&#8217;t work with Chrome yet, most notably Google Analytics and Lively!
      </li>
      <li>
        The save/retrieve password is bit of a miss &#8211; it suggests passwords based on domains only, and not on sub-domain, page basis
      </li>
      <li>
        It may not consume memory but it _does_ eat up a LOT of CPU.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p style="text-align: center;">

    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: left; ">
       
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>The options page is still simplistic, and looks like a direct rip from <span>Firefox</span>. And it uses <span>IE&#8217;s</span> proxy settings! <span>Clcik</span> on proxy, and it loads up the Internet settings used by IE &#8211; pushed out a little too fast?</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        And hey, WTF is it with that shitty 475kb Bootstrapper thingy huh ? 
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <div>
      <span>All in all, Google Chrome has got a nice start &#8211; I will definitely be using both Chrome and <span>Firefox</span> &#8211; lets see what the Big G has in store for the future.</span>
