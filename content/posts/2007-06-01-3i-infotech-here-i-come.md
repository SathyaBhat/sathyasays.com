Well, I'd been to Bangalore to collect my offer letter for a job as Trainee Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.3i-infotech.com" title="3i-Infotech" target="_blank">3i-Infotech</a> yesterday. Most of the people who had cleared the GD, seemed to have cleared the Personal Interview as well, atleast most of the people who were in my group. The joining formalities was headed by a HR person named, Anupama, and boy was she grouchy! Is she always so? Whatever it maybe, I'm glad she wasn't the one taking my interview. The whole formalities(submitting certificates, verification etc) took about 2 hours, but was disappointed to know that our postings still haven't been finalized. Though my offer letter states that my training posting will be in Chennai, Anupama was quick to dismiss that, saying it's not been finalized, neither has our joining date. So I'm waiting for both, and hoping I won't be posted in Chennai. That's about it for now

Cheers!
