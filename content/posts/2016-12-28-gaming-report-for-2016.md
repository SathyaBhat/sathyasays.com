End of the year is here and while other services are busy sending Year in 2016 report, there sparked a mini gaming report in our telegram group and I decided to compile my gaming in 2016 report. At the start of the year I had decided to finish more games this year and I guess I did a pretty decent in accomplishing this. So here&#8217;s my summary

### Games finished this year: {#Games-finished-this-year:}

**PC:**

  * Just Cause 3 &#8211; <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/sathyabhat/screenshots/?appid=225540&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall" target="_blank">Screens</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxKOjmEYzYcT5eyd5_NSXV8TBkuKVy8JP" target="_blank">Video</a>
