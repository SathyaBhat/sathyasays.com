Man, I&#8217;m so pissed off with this darn 1 GB BW cap. Yup, I&#8217;m on the BSNL Home 250 Plan with a free Bandwidth of 1GB. How the hell is that reasonable?? God damn!! I can finish it off in matter of hours, somehow been managing it for a month!!  And today, it&#8217;s just 17th of the month, and already  I&#8217;m used up 0.843 GB of my 1GB  allocation. Arggh. How the hell am I gonna last with 150 MB for the next 13 days is beyond me. Guess &#8216;ll have to start with stop writing here, till the end of the Month(makin a post here and there, doing some reasearch, alone takes up about 10MB! :| Oh God help me get thru the end of the month.
