Only three weeks after Alpha1, we’re glad to announce the release of openSUSE 11.0 Alpha 2. There are various exciting changes in there that we would like to have feedback on.

### Changes since openSUSE 11.0 Alpha 1

  * KDE 4.0.1 replaced KDE 3.5.8 as default KDE
  * GNOME 2.21.90 was integrated
  * Continued work on the Installation workflow
  * Live CDs for both GNOME and KDE
  * CDs support German as an additional language
  * DVDs have only OSS software
  * Linux 2.6.24
  * OpenOffice.org 2.4 Beta
  * Alsa 1.0.16rc2
  * D-Bus 1.2rc2

For a more detailed list with links to backported packages, see the [Factory/News][1] wiki page.

### Most Annoying Bugs

  * Progress dialog _Loading the Package Manager…_ blocks the installation-update proposal ([Bug #359235][2]). Although you can accept the proposal by clicking on [Accept] you can’t see the proposed data/values.
  * KDE3 autostart applications may crash on KDE4 Startup ([Bug #359800][3])
  * Mono apps do not work on the GNOME LiveCD ([Bug #359768][4])
  * Missing graphical menu on Live-CD (<strike>[Bug #359486][5]</strike>)
  * Popups during the installation behave sporadically
