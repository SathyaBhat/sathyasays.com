I probably top the ranks of lazy arses who procrastinate like there&#8217;s no tomorrow &#8211; and then there&#8217;s Fabrice Bellard

> Amongst others, he&#8217;s created/led
> 
>   * [A 4G LTE base station][1] running entirely in software on a standard PC.
>   * [A new ASN1 compiler][2] generating small and efficient C code.
>   * [A PC emulator in Javascript][3]: how much time takes your browser to boot Linux ?
>   * [2700 billion decimal digits of Pi][4] computed with a desktop computer.
>   * [Analog and Digital TV (DVB-T) signal][5] generation by displaying an image on a PC display.
>   * [QEMU][6] is a generic machine emulator and virtualizer.
>   * [FFMPEG][7], the Open Source Multimedia System. I launched this project in year 2000 and led it during several years.
>   * [TCC][8] is a tiny but complete ISOC99 C compiler which enables you to use C as scripting language. TCC has its roots in the [OTCC][9] project. The [TCCBOOT][10] boot loader demonstrate the speed of TCC **by compiling and launching a Linux kernel in less than 15 seconds.**
>   * [QEmacs][11] (for Quick Emacs) is an emacs clone I began to learn Unicode rendering algorithms, text buffers manipulation and XML/HTML/CSS parsing.
>   * [OTCC][9] is a very **small self-compiling compiler** for a subset of C I wrote to win the 2001 edition of the [International Obfuscated C Contest][12].
>   * [TinyGL][13]: a Small, Free and Fast Subset of OpenGL.
>   * An online [Scientific Web Calculator][14].
>   * [Pi][15] formulas, algorithms and computations.
>   * A [tiny C program][16] to print the biggest known prime number.
