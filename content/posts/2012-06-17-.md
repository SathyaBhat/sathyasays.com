&#8220;If I disappear tomorrow, we&#8217;ll have to hoist the flag at half mast but nobody will even notice .. most of the decisions are not done by me there are few people who can take over my work when I&#8217;m on vacation&#8221;.

&#8220;Sometimes I&#8217;m sad that people take me too seriously. Then I say &#8220;Ah screw it&#8221;&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to tone it down just because someone might get hurt&#8221;

&#8220;linux came from a great mind, that mind is not me&#8221;

&#8220;I love being at Univ; I hate writing thesis&#8221;.

&#8220;Startups at early stage are wonderful:

&#8220;nvidia&#8217;s been the single worst hardware company that I&#8217;ve worked with&#8221;

&#8220;I don&#8217;t think every child should be taught to program makes sense&#8221;

&#8220;To me what is important is execution than vision&#8221;
