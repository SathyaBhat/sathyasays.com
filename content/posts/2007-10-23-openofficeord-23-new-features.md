### Chart

The Chart component of OpenOffice.org has undergone a major revamp for 2.3. The developers have added a range of exciting new features, and at the same time made the creation of charts simpler and more logical. The default chart appearance is improved, with a new colour palette. The scaling of axes has been changed to give better results automatically. 3D charts are greatly enhanced in appearance, and easier to create. New chart types include &#8216;3D exploded pies&#8217; and &#8216;exploded donuts&#8217; (watch out Homer Simpson). There is an improved data editor for charts that use their own data (e.g. within Impress).

### Writer

The way Writer displays various page images has been improved. There is a new filter for exporting documents to MediaWiki (&#8220;Wikipedia&#8221;) format

<a name="Calc" title="Calc"></a>

### Calc

Calc now supports inline matrix/array constants in formulas. Summation has been made more powerful and more intuitive. The display of error values has been made more user-friendly. Compatibility with Microsoft Excel has been improved with workarounds for cotangent functions (supported in Calc, missing from Microsoft Excel).

<a name="Base" title="Base"></a>

### Base

Base continues to evolve as a fully-fledged OpenOffice.org application in its own right, with its windows all having their own size, position, etc settings. The Report Builder, available as extension on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/" title="http://extensions.services.openoffice.org" class="external free">http://extensions.services.openoffice.org</a>, now has additional facilities for expert users. There is a greater support for keyboard shortcuts throughout Base.

<a name="Draw" title="Draw"></a>

### Draw

Draw includes a number of accessibility improvements and support for .png images when exporting to .html documents

<a name="Impress" title="Impress"></a>

### Impress

The much-loved &#8216;move along curve&#8217; animation feature has been re-introduced, despite claims that over-use could easily create sea-sickness among sensitive members of an audience.

<a name="Language_Support" title="Language_Support"></a>

### Language Support

Language support has been improved for a further fourteen languages, building on OpenOffice.org&#8217;s already impressive language support.

<a name="Extensions" title="Extensions"></a>

### Extensions

There are a number of new features available to developers of OpenOffice.org extensions, and a one click link to a new extensions repository.

<a name="Other" title="Other"></a>

### Other

Writer, Calc, Draw, and Impress now allow users to preview their work within a browser before exporting it to .html format. The default security level for Macro Security has been changed to High, to make it difficult for users to run possibly malicious macros &#8216;without thinking&#8217;.
