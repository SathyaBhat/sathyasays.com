Due to the licensing restrictions, like most distros, openSUSE don&#8217;t have the codecs bundled along with the installation DVD. But thanks to their 1-click installer, it isn&#8217;t hard to get the Green Chameleon to start playing all those mp3&#8217;s/videos of yours.

It involves just 2 steps!

First, get the Restricted Format 1-click installer. Here&#8217;s the links:

<!--more-->

  * [For KDE Users][1]
  * [For GNOME users][2]

This will enable you to have:

  * Flash
  * Java
  * Latest Amarok (with MP3 Support) for KDE, or Helix-Banshee for GNOME users
  * Encrypted DVD (_libdvdcss_)
  * Extra xine codecs, for MPEG-4 etc. (_libxine1_)
  * K3b with MP3 Support (_k3b-codecs_)
  * Win 32 Codecs (_w32codec-all_)

..as well as the option of installing many more applications (**select _Advanced_ mode at the screen**), including:

  * Opera
  * KMPlayer
  * Kplayer
  * MPlayer
  * Azureus
  * VLC
  * Codeine
  * ..and more

If you skipped installing VLC, then fear not! Install VLC via the 1-Click installer! [Here&#8217;s][3] the link.

That&#8217;s it!
