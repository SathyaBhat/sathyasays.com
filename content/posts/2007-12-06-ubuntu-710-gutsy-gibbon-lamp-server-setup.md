Found this really easy tutorial on setting up a LAMP server at [UbuntuGeek][1]. As the Geek says,<p XP1Fl="true" class="KonaBody">&nbsp;</p> <p XP1Fl="true" class="KonaBody">In around 15 minutes, the time it takes to install Ubuntu Server Edition, you can have a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) server up and ready to go. This feature, exclusive to Ubuntu Server Edition, is available at the time of installation.</p> <p XP1Fl="true" class="KonaBody">&nbsp;</p> <p XP1Fl="true" class="KonaBody">

<a id="more-274"></a>The LAMP option means you don’t have to install and integrate each of the four separate LAMP components, a process which can take hours and requires someone who is skilled in the installation and configuration of the individual applications. Instead, you get increased security, reduced time-to-install, and reduced risk of misconfiguration, all of which results in a lower cost of ownership.New pre-configured installation options have been added to the Ubuntu Server. Mail Server, File Server, Print Server, and Database Server options join existing LAMP and DNS options for pre-configured installations, easing the deployment of common server configurations.</p> <p XP1Fl="true" class="KonaBody">Ubuntu LAMP server Install the following Versions</p> 

  * Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon 7.10
  * Apache 2.2.4
  * Mysql 5.0.45
  * PHP 5.2.3
