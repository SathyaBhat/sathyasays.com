Here&#8217;s a much needed feature, the next version of Ubuntu, Ubuntu 8.04 aka the Hardy Heron will finally feature a XRandR GUI.  This feature has been implemented under Alpha 6.

Basically this allows the user to change, amongst others, resolution, refresh rate, rotation(ie, to rotate the screen by X degrees) on-the-fly, using the RandR 1.2 extension. Previously  the user would have to change the resolution via the screen resolution applet(or worse, by directly editing xorg.conf file) , and restart the X server for the new resolution to take effect. This feature makes it easier for users to change resolutions as and when required. I&#8217;m a bit surprised that it took this long for the feature to be implemented, but nonetheless good to know that the feature is in place
