For all those people who miss Amarok badly while on Windows, well fear not, your dream has come true&#8230;.almost.

With the release of KDE4.0 which uses Qt4 framework, which has been GPL&#8217;d and available for Windows and MacOSX, a lot of effort has been put in to port KDE4 for Windows, which allows Amarok to be run under Windows as well.</p>

At the moment, just a tech preview has been released, and you can get the steps required to install Amarok under Windows over at [KDE techbase][1].Â  Being a tech preview release, it&#8217;s rather buggy. In fact the developers have asked users not to submit any bug reports, because they&#8217;re busy working on the obvious ones. So don&#8217;t expect miracles. In fact, don&#8217;t expect Amarok not to crash.
