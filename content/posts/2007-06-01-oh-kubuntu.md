I&#8217;ve been a SuSE fan over since I tried out Linux back in well&#8230;. April 2000 to be exact(not that I remember, have the CD with me). The one I had tried was of version 6.3, came with [CHIP][1] magazine. Being the geek that I am, decided to try it out and was very impressed, though the display was a less-than-convincing 640&#215;480 @ 60Hz, mainly due to my graphics card, the infamous SiS 6326. Having learned the basics of Linux, I reverted back to Windows, as I didn&#8217;t have an Internet connection then and my &#8220;work&#8221; on my computer was mainly playing few ol&#8217; games. Although I didn&#8217;t give up on Linux completely, tried out few distros, which couldn&#8217;t convince me to shift to Linux.
  
It was only a year or so ago that I gave SuSE 10.0 a shot, and I began to realize why I&#8217;d been a SuSE fan for so long. When openSuSE 10.2 was released, I immediately shifted to it and thought to myself, &#8220;hmmm.. Won&#8217;t be needing another distro for sure&#8221;. Even the much fancied Ubuntu didn&#8217;t make much of an impression on me, partly because of GNOME, which I absolutely detest. Recently when Fiesty Fawn was released, I thought I&#8217;ll give Kubuntu a shot(hey, [ShipIT][2] would send it to me, so why not?). And I&#8217;ve to say, &#8220;Wow!&#8221;(Not the Fista &#8220;Wow!&#8221;). I couldn&#8217;t have been more wrong about my thoughts. I was so impressed, that I actually removed openSuSE and I&#8217;ve totally shifted to Kubuntu. In fact, while I&#8217;m writing this, Kubuntu installation is going in the background, as the picture shows:[][3]

The install took about 45 minutes, which isn&#8217;t too bad since my physical RAM amount is less(Just 256MB). After the install I didn&#8217;t like the default wallpaper, so changed it another one. Have a look at my desktop after install. Now that&#8217;s neat!

Overall not bad. I&#8217;ll be using this for a while and see how it goes. Now for the bad points:

1. *buntu(as most other distros, though) doesn&#8217;t come with codecs or playing mp3 files or videos due to licensing reason. That&#8217;s fine. However when I tried to play a mp3 file under amaroK, it detected that I was about to play a mp3 file and offered to download the codec. This is where the bad part comes, since amaroK hangs up trying to find the codec. I recommend using Adept to get the Ubuntu restricted stuff.

2 . Ubuntu Feisty Fawn comes with a &#8220;Restricted Driver Manager&#8221; which is a neat tool to get the propreitory drivers such as NVIDIA/ATI drivers which offer 3D acceleration. This is glaringly absent in Kubuntu, and you&#8217;ll have to install it manually via Adept. And despite the installation the icon isn&#8217;t created, which makes you believe it&#8217;s not installed, while it actually is. You&#8217;ll have to launch it from Konsole as &#8220;sudo restricted-manager&#8221; to launch it.

So if you haven&#8217;t given Linux a shot yet, I suggest you start off with Ubuntu/Kubuntu. Trust me, you&#8217;ll like it!

Cheers!
