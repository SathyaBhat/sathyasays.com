Many people would like to use windows&#8217; softwares in linux and would also like to run games in linux using wine. Many softwares and games work pretty well and are fully functional using wine. However, people may find it difficult to digest the fact that exe icons do not get displayed. If the exe icons could be made visible, then it will reduce the need to search for the exe file and will make linux and wine more user friendly.

This idea is possible in gnome desktop environment. I seriously dont know about how to accomplish this task in KDE. Please visit [here][1] and [here][2] for complete details

Please comment on the idea and also notify me if anyone knows how to do this in KDE
