> **Why are you doing this?**
> 
>   * Existing languages at this level of abstraction and efficiency are unsatisfactory. In particular:
>   * Too little attention paid to safety.
>   * Poor concurrency support.
>   * Lack of practical affordances, too dogmatic about paradigm.
> 
> **What are some non-goals?**
> 
>   * To employ any particularly cutting-edge technologies. Old, established techniques are better.
>   * To prize expressiveness, minimalism or elegance above other goals. These are desirable but subordinate goals.
>   * To cover the “systems language” part all the way down to “writing an OS kernel”.
>   * To cover the complete feature-set of C++, or any other language. It should provide majority-case features.
>   * To be 100% static, 100% safe, 100% reflective, or too dogmatic in any other sense. Trade-offs exist.
>   * To run on “every possible platform”. It must eventually work without unnecessary compromises on widely-used hardware and software platforms.
