The [Bhutan][1] government liked its first taste of Linux so much that it has come back for seconds, releasing an updated version of its Debian-based operating system that it launched last year.

Launched at the start of this month, Dzongkha [Debian Linux][2] is a Debian-based Linux operating system built in and for the national language, Dzongkha. It can be easily installed on any PC or used as a Live CD.

The updated version will fully support Dzongkha computing on standard programs and applications like word processing, spreadsheets, power point presentations, Web browsing and chatting.

[Department][3] of information and technology officials said this version also has the provision to use Dzongkha in graphics software like [Adobe Photoshop][4], and multimedia applications.

Head developer of the Dzongkha Debian Linux project, [Pema Geley][5] said in a press statement that the first version of Dzongkha Linux was not compatible with most computers, so the operating system has now been updated and made stable.

Developed over a period of 13 months and at about US$80,000, the upgraded version has also dual booting system. It can coexist with both Mac and Windows operating systems.

Plans are apparently also underway to develop software like Text to Speech, Speech Recognition, and Optical Character Recognition on Dzongkha Debian Linux in the second phase.

The Live CDs are available for free from the Department of Information and Technology.

The Debian installer supports 58 languages in total. Several languages even have all texts translated in the installer. KDE and GNOME are also available in many languages.
