Detailed roadmap to follow soon

I look forward to Beta 3 and RC1 release, as they&#8217;re a pretty good indicator as to what openSUSE 11.0 public release will be like.

At the moment, openSUSE developers still haven&#8217;t finalized whether KDE4.0 will be the default desktop environment, but the inclusion of [PulseAudio][1] is great news indeed!
