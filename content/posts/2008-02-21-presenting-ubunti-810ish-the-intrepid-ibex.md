Mark Shuttleworth today posted on the Ubuntu Mailing list, what is planned for the next version of Ubuntu, titled The Intrepid Ibex which would most likely have a version number of 8.10 and be released around October 2008.

To quote him,

> With Hardy now past feature-freeze it&#8217;s time to start to plan
  
> features that are being lined up for inclusion after Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
  
> is released in April.
> 
> And so I&#8217;d like to introduce you to the Intrepid Ibex, the release
  
> which is planned for October 2008, and which is likely to have the
  
> version number 8.10.
  
> The Intrepid Ibex will take shape at our next Ubuntu Developer
  
> Summit, an open event to which members of the Ubuntu community,
  
> upstream communities, corporate developers and other distributions
  
> are all invited. That summit takes place in beautiful Prague, in the
  
> Czech Republic from 19th &#8211; 23rd May 2008. Together we will draw up
  
> detailed blueprints for Ubuntu 8.10. Please join us there to help
  
> define the Intrepid Ibex:
> 
> <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDS-Intrepid>
  
> During the 8.10 cycle we will be venturing into interesting new
  
> territory, and we&#8217;ll need the rugged adventurousness of a mountain
  
> goat to navigate tricky terrain. Our desktop offering will once
  
> again be a focal point as we re-engineer the user interaction model
  
> so that Ubuntu works as well on a high-end workstation as it does on
  
> a feisty little subnotebook. We&#8217;ll also be reaching new peaks of
  
> performance &#8211; aiming to make the mobile desktop as productive as
  
> possible.
  
> Hardy is our best development cycle yet, delivering on our promise
  
> of reliability and stability for the Heron. We must stay focused on
  
> that goal. To the extent that you have a brilliant idea for the
  
> future, you now have a peg to hang it on &#8211; the Intrepid Ibex. When
  
> the Hardy Heron has taken flight we will engage fully with the Ibex.
  
> Give it horns!
