The recent 10.3 version of openSUSE has a great 1-click installer. But getting those 1-click installer packages can be very hard. Fear not, [Dr. Neville][1] from our [Mangalore Linux Users Group][2] found something very useful: [A search engine][3] for openSUSE 1-click Installer search packages!Â  This will be very useful.
