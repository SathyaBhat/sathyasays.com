> KDE’s release notes tout the following (main) features of the 4.6 release:
> 
>   * libplasma now does does something with QML for widgets on devices – why this is the number one feature listed on a PR release about the new release I do not know. It’s hardly sexy;
>   * the reintroduction of activities, which now includes starting and stopping applications as part of an activity. This sounds interesting – more below;
>   * optimization of Kwin. The release notes say that this will LEAD to smoother window management and more stunning desktop effects. So I’m guessing these aren’t in this release;
>   * faceted browsing in dolphin. What I think this means is that you can filter particular files by various categories in a folder view;
>   * git plugin for dolphin – yawn;
>   * introduction of akonadi to the PIM applications.

Note to self: Try the beta. Faceted browsing seems to be very nice.
