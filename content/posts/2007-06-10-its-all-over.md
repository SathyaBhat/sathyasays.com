Well it&#8217;s all over. Finally. The moment I&#8217;ve been waiting for, since 4 years. What am I talking about?? I&#8217;m done with writing exams, that&#8217;s what! 4 freakin&#8217; years of writing the same ol&#8217; mind numbing exams. No more worrying about Mr. Fourier, Laplace, Heaviside&#8217;s transforms(which transform my mind into total madness), no more worrying about noise, in terms of Gaussian, Random, Impulse or Percentage, Decibel or otherwise. No more of Erlang&#8217;s trunking thoery, Queueing systems. No more of Normal Variates, Bivariates, and what not. No more of writing of the same ol&#8217; Harvard, Neumann architectures, Block diagrams of microprocessors and microcontrollers(I swear, I must&#8217;ve read the same old sh!t \*\*atleast\*\* 50 times, written it no less than 10 times. No more wondering, whether to take the Z-transform, or the DFT or DTFT or DTFS or FS, just to get some random bunch of nubmers convolveD! Who the hell cares about convolution, you toss in some random numbers, you get more random numbers, which absolutely no relation. No more wondering whether to use Time Shifting or Frequency shifting, whether to apply Periodicity or Parseval&#8217;s theorem to get more junk of numbers.

No more using of Simplex method, and wondering, whether to Use Big M penalty method or Two-Phase method, whether to choose, VAM, North-West Method, Transportation Algorithm. No more mugging up of gazzilion ways of fabricating Optical Fibers, Semi-Conductors, Junction Diodes n what not. No more obscure acronyms like the aforementioned DTFT, FT, FS, DTFs, TRAPATT, IMPATT, BARITT, VAM etc etc.

Finally,no more of bullshit lecturers who think they know-it-all but are unable to answer even the simplest of queries(Does resistor have polarity??? Hell NO!!!!!). No more. Thank God.

PS: If all some/all of the above made no sense to you, you&#8217;ve no idea how lucky you are!
