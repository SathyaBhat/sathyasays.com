**Very few people lie awake at night fretting over their choice of mobile operating system. In fact, very few people even know what operating system their handset uses.**

Yet, despite this (probably healthy) level of ignorance, a quiet revolution is taking place in the mobile industry. Linux, the platform of choice for servers and geekier desktops the world over, is slowly winding its way onto the high-end smartphone, although no-one is really certain what it will look like when it gets there.

Part of the problem — although some would no doubt view it as a strength — is the number of organisations pushing mobile Linux. There are two main industry groupings dedicated to the cause: the [Linux Mobile (LiMo) Foundation][1] and the [Linux Phone Standards (LiPS) Forum][2]. Some companies are members of both. Others belong to one of the groups, but are implementing their own flavours of mobile Linux. It is little wonder that mobile Linux&#8217;s chances of making inroads in the enterprise space have been played down by some very vocal critics.

Symbian, which does have a foothold in enterprise, thanks largely to its work with Nokia, took aim at the open-source operating system in July, when its head of enterprise business market development, Andrew Moran, [dubbed mobile Linux &#8220;fragmentation city&#8221;][3] and claimed it was &#8220;completely unfeasible&#8221; for business use. But then, Symbian is hardly likely to welcome Linux with open arms.
