KDE commnunity recently launched a dedicated forum over at <a href="http://forum.kde.org" target="_blank">forum.kde.org</a>

The forum will complement the already existing and pretty exhaustive <a href="http://userbase.kde.org/" target="_blank">KDE User Base</a> for support and other resources. Having a dedicated forum for a desktop environment is a really good thing, it should help users get help right from the horse&#8217;s mouth.

The forums include sections like News, Tips, How-to&#8217;s, Releases, Commits, Look and Feel, Localization and lot more!.

So if you&#8217;re having trouble with KDE, just drop by KDE forums, and post away!
