Being a gamer &#8211; I&#8217;m always on the lookout for new games &#8211; while I do enjoy some of the &#8220;big-name&#8221; games &#8211; there are few of those little known games which are fantastically awesome. World of Goo is one of those.

World of Goo &#8211; in a nutshell can be described as a extreme-physics-added version of Lemmings. Basically you have to &#8220;guide&#8221; the &#8220;goo-balls&#8221; to the specified pipes &#8211; seems easy, well that&#8217;s where the Physics & levels come in. The levels aren&#8217;t the straight forward ones, you have to build bridges, towers by &#8220;Connecting&#8221; the goo balls from one to other.

There are different types of goo-balls, each with their own unique set of properties and behaviours. I suppose this write-up isn&#8217;t doing much in making you understand, best would be to play it and experience it yourself &#8211; it is a wonderful and unique game.

Graphics wise its plain 2D with little hints of 3D but then its all rendered beautifully, and have a really nice cartoony-look. Audio is where World of Goo really stands out &#8211; the score is awesome, and immerses you totally into the game.

The game soundtrack is available as a free download &#8211; and you can download it from <a href="http://kylegabler.com/WorldOfGooSoundtrack/" target="_blank">here</a>.

The game, while is not free &#8211; you can purchase it for $20, you can download the free demo version and evaluate it and see how it is &#8211; the demo version offers you only the First chapter of the of the total Five chapters available. I do  urge you to try the demo version &#8211; you just might be surprised how addictive the game can be.
