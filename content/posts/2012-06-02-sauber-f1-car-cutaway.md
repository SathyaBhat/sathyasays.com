[Sauber F1 Team &#8211; World Premiere: Cutaway F1 Race Car &#8211; YouTube][1].



The Sauber F1 team has this video of a F1 car spliced right in the middle, showing us all the components that make up a F1 car. OF all the years that I&#8217;ve been watching Formula 1, I think this is the first time I&#8217;ve seen such detailed info about a F1 car.

What&#8217;s fascinating to me is the driver&#8217;s(Sergio Pérez in the video) sitting position. Damn that&#8217;s way too close for comfort!
