<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Debian and other debian-based distros like</span> Ubuntu <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">have</span>, by default, has the root account disabled as a security measure.(thanks to Subbu and PICCORO for the clarification)

To re-enable the root account, just open the command prompt, and type

> `sudo passwd root`

You&#8217;ll get the following set of messages:

> `sathya@sathya-laptop:~$ sudo passwd root<br />
Enter new UNIX password:<br />
Retype new UNIX password:<br />
passwd: password updated successfully<br />
sathya@sathya-laptop:~$`

To disable root access, just type

> `sudo passwd -l root`

If you&#8217;re weary of using the command line(you shoudn&#8217;t ;) ) then there&#8217;s another way:
  
Just head over to System > Administration > Login Window > Security > and check mark the box beside Allow local system administrator login.

DISCLAIMER: Christof Baumann mentions in [**this**][1] post as to why you shouldn&#8217;t fiddle with the root account:

> Be aware of locking the root account if you once activated it. I activated the root account and skipped the %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL line int /etc/sudoers file because i thought i wouldnâ€™t need it anymore. Then i disabled the root account without thinking and now had no chance to start programs with root rights. Luckily i could restore it using a knoppix live cd. Be aware of changing settings concerning the root account.

Also, read [**this**][2] article in Ubuntu Wiki as to why sudo is preferred over standard root account.

PS: Just incase you guys are wondering why I&#8217;ve posted this basic info so late, well I&#8217;m just getting the hang of Ubuntu.
