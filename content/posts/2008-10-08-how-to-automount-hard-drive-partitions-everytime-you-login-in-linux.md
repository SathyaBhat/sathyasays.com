Hello people,

This is Bharath Ram. I wanted to share with you an information I just found. This indeed solved my problem so I thought it would solve yours too.

In ubuntu (and may be in other distros) every time you login you never get your drives auto mounted (don&#8217;t you?). This is a real pest especially when you would have set your wallpaper from an external drive or some other reason you want to use external drives for.

I have just found out a solution for this problem. That is no big deal but a small software called &#8220;pysdm&#8221;. It was there for me in the ubuntu repositories but i seriously don&#8217;t know about other distros. Install this software and if necessary open it after install (alt+f2 -> type &#8220;pysdm&#8221; -> enter) and in the options there say to automount your partition(s) at startup. Now the drives of ur hard disk will be mounted whenever you login. You won&#8217;t have to manually/using computer mount them.

Hope this helps

P.S-Please post your comments if you need any help or if this has helped you out!
