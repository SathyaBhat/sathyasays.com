I&#8217;ve owned a Sony Ericsson HBH-DS970 for [nearly 2 years now][1]{#aptureLink_GW9kUit5Kx}, and I use it pretty often with my previous phone ( the [Sony Ericsson P1i][2]{#aptureLink_Szc3RZREO3} ), and my current iPhone 3G. I also use it occasionally on my laptop. It has worked fine in Windows XP, Vista & Windows 7. Getting it to work with Linux, however has been an EPIC FAIL. The last time I tried it was probably a year ago, and I just gave up in frustration and continued to use my EP-630 as the earphone.

<!--more-->

The situation however changed when recently some <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">bloody fucking bastard</span> person [stole my EP-630][3]{#aptureLink_NSxWrq0F8x} in office &#8211; since I don&#8217;t have any other headset, I got all &#8220;enthu&#8221; about trying to get this ting working. And now all that enthusiasm has gone, and I&#8217;m on the verge of giving up again. So let me point as to what steps I \*have\* tried.

  * [bluetooth-alsa on SourceForge][4]

Result: FAIL. Couldn&#8217;t build the required files, couldn&#8217;t get the required development files &#8211; packages do not exist as they have been obsoleted, and the method itself obsoleted.

  * [bluez wiki][5]

Result: FAIL. Configured the .asoundrc file, added hcid.conf files, on testing with mplayer got an error message:

> `[AO_ALSA] alsa-lib: audio/pcm_bluetooth.c:1607:(audioservice_expect) BT_GET_CAPABILITIES failed : Input/output error(5)<br />
[AO_ALSA] Playback open error: Input/output error`

Tried with arecord:

> `sathya@shaman:~> arecord -D bluetooth -f S16_LE | aplay -D bluetooth -f S16_LE<br />
ALSA lib audio/pcm_bluetooth.c:1607:(audioservice_expect) BT_GET_CAPABILITIES failed : Input/output error(5)<br />
arecord: main:608: audio open error: Input/output error<br />
ALSA lib audio/pcm_bluetooth.c:1607:(audioservice_expect) BT_GET_CAPABILITIES failed : Input/output error(5)<br />
aplay: main:608: audio open error: Input/output error`

  * [FOSSwire article: A2DP on Linux][6]

Result: FAIL. Tried their script, seemed to work but no. At the end of script got an error message

> `Starting up...<br />
Traceback (most recent call last): File "a2dp.py", line 7, in bus_id = manager.ActivateService('audio')<br />
dbus.exceptions.DBusException: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod: Method "ActivateService" with signature "s" on interface "org.bluez.Manager" doesn't exist` 

The author mentions this error is because this method is now obsolete.

  * [FOSSwire:Â  Better Bluetooth Audio in Linux][7]

Got stuck when I issued:

> `pactl load-module module-alsa-sink device="bluetooth"`

Error being:

> `<br />
sathya@shaman:~> pactl load-module module-alsa-sink device="bluetooth"<br />
Failure: Module initalization failed`

Slick.

  * [IT Toolbox: Mission Impossble? Connect Bluetooth Headset to Linux][8]

Result: Didn&#8217;t bother. Same as attempt #2.

I&#8217;ve just about given up trying to get this damn thing working. If you have any suggestions/advice, do drop a comment. FYI: I&#8217;m on openSUSE, my headset is a Sony Ericsson HBH DS970.
