From [Adobe Flash Team Player blog][1]:

> I'm thrilled to announce that Adobe Flash Player 10.1 is now available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. You can get it [now][2].

Some nice features:

>   * With Flash Player 10.1, we added new functionality that detects when memory is running low. Now, content that runs in Flash Player will automatically shut down when the available memory is running low.
>   * Flash Player can now automatically reduce the power consumption for content running in the background on a non-visible browser tab to improve performance when users are multitasking. In cases where audio is playing in the background, playback fidelity is maintained.
>   * For desktops, Flash Player 10.1 introduces hardware-based H.264 video decoding _(yay!)_
>   * Smart seek can easily make using Flash Player a DVR-like experience. Smart seek allows the video viewer to seek within a new &#8220;back&#8221; buffer so viewers can easily rewind or fast forward video
>   * [&#8230;] using a new set of ActionScript 3 APIs for multi-touch and native gesture events, creating the ability to interact with multiple objects simultaneously or work with native gestures, such as pinch, scroll, rotate, scale, and two-finger tap.

Time to update. Hope performance has improved lots under Linux.
