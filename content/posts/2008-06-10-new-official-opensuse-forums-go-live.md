The official openSUSE forums has been established and went live yesterday on June 9th, 2008, providing better support for openSUSE community. The Forums merges 3 existing openSUSE forums, suseforums.net, my personal favourite suselinuxsupport.de and the openSUSE support forums at forums.novell.com.

You could use single sign-on login with your Novell/openSUSE account. Your account at existing forums &#8211;  will also work.

Behind the scenes, a project team consisting of Novell employees, openSUSE Community members, and existing forums’ staff have been working on this project since the beginning of 2008. The new infrastructure will be hosted by Novell to ensure the highest possible quality of service.

So if you&#8217;re facing any problem with your openSUSE box, or would require help in setting up openSUSE on your system, head over to the official **[openSUSE Forums][1]**
