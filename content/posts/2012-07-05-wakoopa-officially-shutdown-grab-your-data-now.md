About 2 weeks ago, Wakoopa announced that they will be shutting down their <a title="Wakoopa is dead" href="http://techie-buzz.com/tech-news/wakoopa-service-made-software-social-comes-end.html" target="_blank">social network soon</a> & focusing on &#8220;Corporate Research&#8221;.

Unfortunately that day is here. Just received an email stating that as of today, you can grab an <a href="http://social.wakoopa.com/" target="_blank">export of your data</a>.

This is what they have to say about the export

>   The export is a CSV file containing the following columns: application name, subcategory, category, the number of seconds you&#8217;ve used the application in the hour, the hour you&#8217;ve used the application in, the date of the usage, the operating system and your user id.

Too bad Wakoopa&#8217;s no longer going to be around. Wakoopa would be the first software I&#8217;d install &#8211; even before installing the drivers. There was something analysing the data about what software you use for how long, and which software did I use the most in the background. Now, I&#8217;m not really sure what to do with the data. I don&#8217;t think Rescue Time supports importing Wakoopa data &#8211; it&#8217;d be sweet if they did. Maybe see if I can stuff if into <a title="procrastitracker" href="http://procrastitracker.com/" target="_blank">ProcrastiTracker</a>?
