<font size="2">Linus has tagged the final release of kernel 2.6.23. Grab a copy from kernel.org and give it a run through if you&#8217;ve been waiting on features, which includes the new, better, fairer CFS process scheduler, a simpler read-ahead mechanism, the lguest &#8216;Linux-on-Linux&#8217; paravirtualization hypervisor, XEN guest support, KVM smp guest support, variable process argument length, make SLUB the default slab allocator, SELinux protection for exploiting null dereferences using mmap, XFS and ext4 improvements, PPP over L2TP support, the &#8216;lumpy&#8217; reclaim algorithm, a userspace driver framework, the O_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag, splice improvements, new fallocate() syscall, lock statistics, support for multiqueue network devices, various new drivers and many other minor features and fixes.</p>

    &#8220;Finally.

  <p>
    Yeah, it got delayed, not because of any huge issues, but because of<br /> various bugfixes trickling in and causing me to reset my &#8220;release clock&#8221;<br /> all the time. But it&#8217;s out there now, and hopefully better for the wait.

    I want this to be what people look at for a few days, but expect the x86<br /> merge to go ahead after that. So far, all indications are still that it&#8217;s<br /> going to be all smooth sailing, but hey, those indicators seem to always<br /> say that, and only after the fact do people notice any problems <img src="http://www.tuxmachines.org/misc/smileys/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" />

  <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=home">Phoronix</a> have conducted some <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=872&num=1">preliminary benchmarks</a> and report that &#8220;These are just our very initial benchmarks from the Linux 2.6.23 kernel and by no means can any definitive conclusions be drawn. From these common Phoronix benchmarks, the performance difference was minimal with only a very small performance boost in RAMspeed. However, thanks in large part to the new Linux scheduler there are performance improvements in other areas not covered by these benchmarks (especially when multi-tasking). Once we have tested this kernel more thoroughly, we will be back with additional information.&#8221;
