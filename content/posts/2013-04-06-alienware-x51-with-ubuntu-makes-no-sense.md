This morning in my half-woken state, as I was checking Hacker News, I spotted this piece about Alienware launching the X51 with Ubuntu. I initially thought I was dreaming, and woke up immediately and read the piece, and I was left dumbfounded when I read it again to be sure.

> Kind of dumbfounded at Dell launching an Alienware X51 with Ubuntu <a href="http://alienware.com/ubuntu/" target="_blank">http://alienware.com/ubuntu/</a> Not sure what&#8217;s Dell thinking &#8211; there aren&#8217;t any great native AAA games available, can&#8217;t imagine this would make studios to make Linux ports either

&#8211; <a href="https://alpha.app.net/sathyabhat/post/4511352" target="_blank">Me, on app.net</a>

<a href="http://failgunner.com/" target="_blank">Mikhail</a> echoed his thoughts <a href="https://alpha.app.net/failgunner/post/4511540" target="_blank">on this as well</a>

> As much as some people want it, I don’t see AAA gaming shifting out of windows anytime soon. Even if Valve manages to do something it might kill stuff on win8 but tons of people use 7 so they are fine?
> 
> Even on GOG, most games are windows only. Unless the next windows has something worse than win 8 for other apps and games , i dont see it happening.

I honestly don&#8217;t get what Dell is aiming for here. I wonder if some dude at Dell heard that gaming on Ubuntu is on the rise, and thought this would be a good way to ride the wave and get some PR. Incidentally, the same thought is currently the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5502412" target="_blank">top most comment on Hacker News</a>.

> This seems like the sort of thing where they don&#8217;t really care whether they sell any or not. Gaming on Ubuntu is a hot blog topic right now, so they took an existing product and put Ubuntu on it. Probably cost a couple thousand to do all the paperwork surrounding a new SKU, and they&#8217;ll probably sell enough of these to make cover that. Boom, Free marketing and some cred with the indie gaming & Linux community. And if Steam on Linux does take off, they&#8217;ve already got their foot in the door.

Call me a cynic, but this is exactly what it sounds like. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there&#8217;s definitely a (niche) market for pre-built, certified for Linux, desktops/laptops(and <a href="https://www.system76.com" target="_blank">System76</a>, for example)&#8230; Dell&#8217;s <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/os-applications/w/wiki/3685.dell-xps-13-laptop-developer-edition-a-client-to-cloud-solution-project-sputnik.aspx" target="_blank">Project Sputnik makes sense</a>. Latitude/Precision series of Linux laptops makes sense. Heck even the Chromebooks make sense, but right now, the X51 with Ubuntu is just stupid.

Why? I&#8217;ll go back to a rant I had stored when Steam for Linux was announced

> The success of Linux Gaming doesn&#8217;t depend on Steam, it depends on the game devs. Steam for Mac was here like like when? 3 years ago? There are hardly 500 games, most of them indie. The only recent high-profile game that I know is there for the Mac is Diablo III.
> 
> Indie games are great, God bless devs for struggling and slogging their asses, but ultimately AAA games is what drives the industry.
> 
> I&#8217;ll repeat what I said when Steam for Linux and Steam for Mac was announced: Steam is a platform. Build a new bus stand on a deserted place with no buses, you won&#8217;t get hundreds of people at the bus stand.
> 
> Is it great that Steam has arrived? Sure. Does it mean that &#8220;age of Linux gaming&#8221; is coming? No. All we have right now is one functioning SteamWorks game. Even if we consider all of Valve&#8217;s games, that&#8217;s not more than 10.

And Mac&#8217;s market share is roughly what, 10x the Linux desktop base? Hell, even on the X51&#8217;s highlights page you have this

> **With over 25 gaming titles** available and more being added, users can access Steam For Linux to play online games, including your favorite titles like Team Fortress 2 and Serious Sam 3.

I mean really, really? Hell I&#8217;m bloody sure even the NextBox/PS4 will have more launch titles than this(not exclusives, mind you &#8211; but that&#8217;s a different story altogether). Even if there aren&#8217;t any launch titles, you can be guaran-damn-teed (excuse the WWE slang) that devs will come out with games for the the X360/PS3/PS4/NextBox.

I don&#8217;t see any such thing happening on the Linux desktop gaming side. By now, I&#8217;m pretty sure whoever&#8217;s reading this, are yelling SteamBox, SteamBox. Considering that it still officially doesn&#8217;t exist, and a prototype that was shown at CES was announced as <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-11-valve-backed-xi3-piston-console-starts-at-USD1000" target="_blank">lolucrazy-that-aint-steambox</a> by Valve, that pretty much tosses that out of the factor. Even if introduced, I won&#8217;t be surprised if it&#8217;s a custom-closed-system, much like today&#8217;s console.
