In my stash of ebooks, quite a few of them are in chm (compiled HTML) file format. Being HTML files I though they&#8217;d open in Mozilla Firefox browser. Unfortunately that didn&#8217;t work, so I started looking for CHM viewers. I didn&#8217;t have to look far, a quick search on Google gave me couple of programs.

  1. KChmViewer: Since I&#8217;m a KDE user I tried out this application &#8211; and it works fantastic. Really nice, and neat. Download it from <http://www.kchmviewer.net/> or just search for it from your Package Manager. The latest version adds KDE4 support as well, though its still in beta

  2. Gnochm: If you&#8217;re a Gnome fan, you can try out Gnochm as well. Download Gnochm from [here][2].

  Note: Both screenshots were taken from their respective sites. I haven&#8217;t tried Gnochm, so I can&#8217;t comment on how well it performs, KChmViewer is really good!

  If you want to convert the chm file to standard HTML files, then you can try out <a href="http://archmage.sourceforge.net/">Archmarge</a>
