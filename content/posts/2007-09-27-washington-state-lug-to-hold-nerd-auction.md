As part of a PR stunt, a Washington Linux user group is holding a &#8220;[<font color="#555555">Nerd Auction</font>][1]&#8221; and appealing to local sororities to exchange dates and makeover advice for their computer skills and homework assistance. &#8216;The problem is that we&#8217;re all still nerds. Let&#8217;s face it, guys. If anyone&#8217;s going to bid on us, we&#8217;ll need some spicing up,&#8217; writes Washington State Linux Users Group president Ben Ford on the group&#8217;s [<font color="#000000">website</font>][2]. &#8216;And who better to help with that than sorority girls who like nothing better than a makeover?&#8217; So far there has been no comment on how a Linux user group is going to help sorority girls with their Windows machines
