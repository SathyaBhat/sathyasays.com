<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/" target="_blank">Undertale</a> is a game that&#8217;s been getting rave reviews from quite a few people &#8211; <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/undertale" target="_blank">critics or otherwise</a>. Some choice comments

<a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/13/undertale-review" target="_blank">IGN</a>:

> It&#8217;s hard to express just how much I adore Undertale without spoiling anything significant, but that&#8217;s what I love about it. It tells its story in such a dynamic way, and with such a great understanding of the RPG player’s mindset, that it couldn’t have been told in any other way. It&#8217;s a masterfully crafted experience that I won&#8217;t forget any time soon

> The complexities woven deeply into this initially unassuming RPG are enough to keep you invested long after you’ve watched the end credits for the first time. It’s been a long, long time since this style of RPG has grabbed me as _Undertale_ has, and even longer since a small independent effort has been so ambitious, impressive, and unquestionably successful.

inspired by this and egged on by Rishi

And so I did play. Or tried to anyway. But I failed. It was during my conversation with Rishi about <a href="http://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/undertale-review-791303" target="_blank">his review</a> that I was able to elaborate what exactly I didn&#8217;t like about Undertale:

> Sathya: that game is broken at the start
  
> Rishi: Lolwut?How?
> 
> Sathya: from telling you being pacifist is ok and when you take that approach you get clobbered.
  
> Rishi: Yup
> 
> Sathya:the wait for a while was bs _(ie, the bit where Toriel keeps calling you.. Cute at first and soon enough gets infuriating. )_
  
> Rishi: Mentioned that. Stupid communication fail
> 
> Sathya. I ended up restarting the game because I got tired
  
> Rishi: :joy:
> 
> Sathya: honestly if it wasn&#8217;t for your recommendation long back I&#8217;d have never touched it. The music is charming but the repeatitiveness gets on your nerves. Bear in mind these are all impressions from the first hour
  
> Rishi: You&#8217;re spot on
> 
> _(I later found that the repetition is actually a style of music called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif" target="_blank">Leitmotifs</a>). _
> 
> Sathya: yes I know how good it is supposed to be and all
  
> Sathya: But &#8216;m fraid with a start like this, they&#8217;ve effectively driven away lot of folks. Hear about it => launch => nice music => charming => wtf? ==> wtf am I doing? ==> why the fuck do I keep falling???!!?? => argh that damn music SHUT UP already => rage quit
  
> _(side note; yes, I know about the sign boards. But these are something that I tend to gloss over and observe much later)_
  
> These were the first impressions when I first played
> 
> Rishi: Yup. It&#8217;s exclusionary. You have to have loved old RPGs from Japan to like it
  
> Sathya: I see.

Undertale does have enough charm to it that I&#8217;ll get back to playing it soon, but every item I think of launching it, I&#8217;m reminded of my first hour playthrough experience and I question myself &#8211; do I really need to experience that all over again? Well..
