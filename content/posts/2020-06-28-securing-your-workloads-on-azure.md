I had the privilege of being able to talk about what you can do to improve your Azure account security and improve the security posture of your workloads running on Azure as part of Microsoft For Startups' Highway to a 100 Unicorns - [Scale Up Thursdays webinar series](https://microsoftcloudpartner.eventbuilder.com/h2huthu). You can catch the video on demand by registering over at [https://aka.ms/secgen](https://aka.ms/secgen). The slides are available on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/sathyabhat/securing-workloads-on-azure) as well on my [Talks](/talks) section.
