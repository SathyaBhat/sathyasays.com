Here&#8217;s something [Preshit][1] told me about yesterday on IM, [Wubuntu][2]!! That&#8217;s Web Ubuntu! Here&#8217;s what the developers had to say about Wubuntu:

&#8220;Welcome to Wubuntu, the Ubuntu interface as a website. I started this project because I thought it was a challange to make something look like an operating system. In this case i chose Ubuntu, since I had already done Vista :P

Wubuntu stands for **W**eb **U**buntu, in case you wondered what the W was doing there ;-) (Come on, we have Edubuntu, Kubuntu, why not Wubuntu?)

Remember, you need the font Segoe UI for this site. All other fonts suck. And if you&#8217;re browsing with Internet Explorer, press WIN + R, type format d: /y and install Linux. You&#8217;ll like it ;-) (Now seriously, this site just looks fucked up on MSIE. Because it&#8217;s fcked up too :-) )&#8221;

Hell, you can even browse using the &#8220;Firefox&#8221; app, by clicking on its icon.

Worth having a look at!

PS: Don&#8217;t forget to have look at the &#8220;kernel logs&#8221;, sure to bring out a smile on your face!
