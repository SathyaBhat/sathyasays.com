I love MusicBrainz Picard. It keeps my [music collection organized, tags and renames them][1], and heck even fetches the cover art for (almost) all songs. Picard is just brilliant.

And the icing on the cake - its FOSS & cross platform. And it was working fine - till couple of days ago.
  


Eager to try out the RC of the upcoming 4.4 release of KDE, I upgraded it. Later on I got a bunch of music files from Ankit, and I set to tag 'em correctly. Double clicked Picard. Bouncy icon starts, and then - nothing. Uh-oh. Rinse, repeat, no change. Wondering what could've happened, I launched Konsole and passed the command And - boom.

Seems the upgrade in Qt has resulted in MusicBrainz Picard being broken :(. As of now there seems to be no solution - perhaps wait and watch till someone notices and fixes it ? Or dive into code and try to fix it myself ( mmm enticing). Anybody reading this has a solution ? Do drop a comment
