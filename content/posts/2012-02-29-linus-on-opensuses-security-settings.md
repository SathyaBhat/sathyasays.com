> I first spent weeks arguing on a bugzilla that the security policy of requiring the root password for changing the timezone and adding a new wireless network was moronic and wrong.
  
> I think the wireless network thing finally did get fixed, but the timezone never did &#8211; it still asks for the admin password.

> So here&#8217;s a plea: if you have anything to do with security in a distro, and think that my kids (replace &#8220;my kids&#8221; with &#8220;sales people on the road&#8221; if you think your main customers are businesses) need to have the root password to access some wireless network, or to be able to print out a paper, or to change the date-and-time settings, please just kill yourself now.
