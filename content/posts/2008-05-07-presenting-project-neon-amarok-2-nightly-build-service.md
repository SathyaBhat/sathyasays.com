Project Neon is the codename for a nightly build service for Amarok 2.

Neon is intended to be used by everyone who wants to help us find bugs, keep track of development, join development or just wants to live on the bleeding edge. **It is <span id="rmpm0"><strong id="nec20">not</strong></span> intended to be used** **instead** of a stable and full featured Amarok.

Packages for Amarok 2 for Kubuntu are available, and packages for openSUSE should be coming up soon.

To install it on Kubuntu Hardy add the following line to your _/etc/apt/sources.list_ file**:
  
** 

> _<span><strong>deb https://ppa.launchpad.net/project-neon/ubuntu hardy main</strong></span>
  
>_ 

check for updates, install **amarok-nightly**
