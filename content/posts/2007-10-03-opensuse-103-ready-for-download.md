Ahead of its October 4th release date, the ISO images of [openSUSE][1] 10.3 have been quietly released to [download mirrors][2] over the weekend. The official release announcement should follow on Thursday, but it&#8217;s nice to see that the download infrastructure is being set up several days in advance to prevent any bottlenecks when the great download rush starts. Just remember that if you have fast Internet connection, you no longer need to download the large openSUSE DVDs; instead, just get the single-CD installation media with either KDE or GNOME for basic installation and add any software packages you need in a post-installation step. openSUSE 10.3 is the project&#8217;s first release in nearly 10 months; it comes with Linux kernel 2.6.22, X.Org 7.2, a KDE desktop that is based on version 3.5 but includes applications and elements from the upcoming version 4.0, GNOME 2.20, OpenOffice.org 2.3.0, and a long list of other cutting-edge software applications (here are the [release notes][3]).
