**ShipIt prepares to start shipping Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) CDs**

If you are an Ubuntu fan you would have tried out their ShipIt service which delivers the Ubuntu CDs for free at your door step.

The service is currently down as they are preparing to start the shipment of the upcoming release of Ubuntu which would be Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon).

The homepage of the site confirms that they would be shipping the CDs of the upcoming version.

After logging in however, the user is told that the service is currently down and it would be back in a couple of days.
