  <span class="author">Bruce Henderson</span>, <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/story/599471.html">The Charlotte Observer</a> reports,
</p>

&#8220;Bob Teixeira decided it was time to take a stand against U.S. dependence on foreign oil. So last fall the Charlotte musician and guitar instructor spent $1,200 to convert his 1981 diesel Mercedes to run on vegetable oil. He bought soybean oil in 5-gallon jugs at Costco, spending about 30 percent more than diesel would cost.

His reward, from a state that heavily promotes alternative fuels: a $1,000 fine last month for not paying motor fuel taxes. He has been told to expect another $1,000 fine from the federal government.

To legally use veggie oil, state officials told him, he would have to first post a $2,500 bond.

Teixeira is one of a growing number of fuel-it-yourselfers &#8212; backyard brewers who recycle restaurant grease or make moonshine for their car tanks. They do it to save money, reduce pollution or thumb their noses at oil sheiks.

They&#8217;re also caught in a web of little-known state laws that can stifle energy independence.

State Sen. Stan Bingham, R-Denton, is known around Raleigh for his diesel Volkswagen fueled by used soybean oil. The car sports a &#8220;Goodbye, OPEC&#8221; sign.

&#8220;If somebody was going to go to this much trouble to drive around in a car that uses soybean oil, they ought to be exempt&#8221; from state taxes, he said.

The state Department of Revenue, which fined Teixeira, has asked legislators to waive the $2,500 bond for small fuel users. The department also told Teixeira, after the Observer asked about his case this week, that it will compromise on his fine.&#8221;

Hmm, poor fella, does his bit to reduce oil consumption(albeit, for his own reasons, but nonetheless he \*does\* make an effort, doesn&#8217;t he?) and he gets fined!
