Well as of today, August 9th, the openSuSE projects turns 2. here&#8217;s an excerpt:

&#8220;In the past 365 days we successfully released [openSUSE 10.2][1] with numerous improvements and new features. Up until now it has been installed hundreds of thousands of times. We brought the [Build Service][2] to a broader audience as an open source project with cool features like release management, build monitoring package tags, statistics, an ever improving [command line client][3], patterns and one click installations. This must have impressed [AMD][4] because they quickly became a Platinum Sponsor. The [software/download page][5] was completely rewritten and relaunched. Several other sites appeared, including but not limited to [opensuse-community.org][6], [suse-art.org][7] to share your openSUSE artwork, the [Localization Portal][8] to help bring openSUSE to your language, Benji’s [package search][9] tool, our own [idea pool][10], several localized openSUSE wikis, and not to forget [this site][11] here.&#8221;

&#8220;While we are at the topic of opening up. The [YaST][12], [Limal][13] and [Zypp][14] developers completely moved everything under the hood of openSUSE. We launched our own [SVN server][15] and are trying to bring the various package repositories together into one [software portal][16]. We also had some fascinating ideas implemented during our [Hackweek][17], for instance a [Build Service project][18] that recompiles Debian packages or [Giver][19] for easy file sharing. The first versions of [KIWI][20], our imaging technology, appeared which helps everybody to deploy their own versions of openSUSE&#8221;

&#8221;

### … and even more things to come!

Today the first beta release of openSUSE 10.3 with lots of new features arrives. The final release is only 2 months away! The localization project has [taken over][21] all the translations for 10.3. This weekend we will try to [slash][22] as many bugs as we can. We are working vigorously on building the distribution inside the Build Service and implementing a framework for contributions. The Software Portal is coming on, and more and more people are [joining][23] the openSUSE packagers team. There are more openSUSE images built with KIWI coming; the latest addition is an image for USB sticks. We will have weekly interviews here under the category People of openSUSE. The final draft of the guiding principles was just released and we have to form the openSUSE Board. Also in the pipe are various re-designs of our web pages. The splash on [www.opensuse.org][24] and the download/software pages will be followed by the wikis and the Build Service. And this won’t be everything that is coming in the next year, we promise!

So enjoy this day and have some cake or a drink on openSUSE.&#8221;

Happy Birthday!!!
