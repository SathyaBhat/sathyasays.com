Ubuntu a 7.10 (Gutsy) build will feature Xorg BulletProof-X feature, which provides a failsafe mode that will ensure that users [never have to manually configure their graphics hardware][1] settings from the command line. If Xorg fails to start,the failsafe mode will initiate with minimalistic settings, low resolution, and a limited number of colors. The failsafe mode also automatically runs Ubuntu&#8217;s new GTK-based display configuration utility so that users can easily test various display settings and choose a configuration that will work properly with their hardware.&#8221;
