_**Whacko** : lets pay a tribute to the worlds best software windows
  
**Geek** : Yeah! Right!_
  
**Whacko** :At present its the most used Operating system in the world
  
**Geek** :Not to mention the worst.
  
**Whacko** :Hey Windows XP and Windows Vista are the best.
  
**Geek** : Its more like Windows letsPee and Windows it&#8217;s-Stuck
  
**Whacko** : Why do you say that?
  
**Geek** :Obvious isn&#8217;t it. Hackers exploit Windows letsPee so easily that its like they are peeing on you. Windows it&#8217;s-Stuck is so slow that people think its stuck.
  
**Whacko** : So what windows lets me do a lot of stuff. All I have to do is buy a security suite and I am safe.
  
**Geek** : Linux lets most of that and that too for free. Morever you are not safe even with that security suite of yours. Its very easy for a hacker to get past all your protections.
  
**Whacko** : There are so many softwares that let me do anything on windows.
  
**Geek** :Ok! Then does it let you fly?
  
**Whacko** :No! but they are working on it. Can linux play games?
  
**Geek** :No!but they are working on it. Moreover I have Doom-3, Unreal-Tournament , Quake, CounterStrike and torcs.Plus we have found a way to get dx-9 in linux.
  
**Whacko** :Windows installation is very easy.
  
**Geek** : Well they had to make it easy with the way it has to be re-installed every 2 to 3 months. Morever even my little brother can install Ubuntu.
  
**Whacko** :Well I couldn&#8217;t install it.
  
**Geek** :The reason is obvious isn&#8217;t it.
  
**Whacko** :With Windows Vista the WOW starts now.
  
**Geek** :You shouldn&#8217;t be too sure of that cause with windows you press start to turn off the computer.
  
**Whacko** :Well Linux sucks and is gay.
  
**Geek** :Ya it sucks in more and more windows users everyday and makes them gay(as in happy for those guys who take it the wrong way;) )
  
**Whacko** :Oh yeah! Windows is going to save the world along with the Intels Classmate PC.
  
**Geek** :Yeah! by killing them. Enough of fighting now. You have lost.
  
_So guys lets give the \_|\_ to windows_
