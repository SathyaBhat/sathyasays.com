The live version of openSUSE 10.3 is now available as a GNOME or KDE CD. Both contain the same software as the 1 CD installation versions would provide you with, but as a live version. The live system can be used as a productive system or rescue system. You can also use it to just check out how openSUSE 10.3 runs on your computer without touching your hard drive. The Live CDs are available as 32bit versions in US English only and also **contain, for the first time, an install option** on the desktop. You can see a screenshot of the KDE Live CD below: <a href="http://sathyasays.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/opensuse-live-cd.png" rel="lightboxsathya" title="openSUSE 10.3 Live CD"></a>

If you click on the _Install_ icon you will be guided through the installation of openSUSE 10.3 onto your hard drive. For now the images are available at:

  * [openSUSE 10.3 GNOME Live][1]
  * [openSUSE 10.3 KDE Live][2]

The Live CDs version will be incorporated into [software.openSUSE.org][3] over the next few days.
