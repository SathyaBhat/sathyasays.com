Uh-huh. Riiight. Maybe he didn't look at the image.

Well, he got a pretty descriptive [bug report][3]. Hilarious.

> Install or upgrade Ubuntu 10.10
> 
> Expected Results:
> 
> Expecting a cool and awesome looking wallpaper for "the perfect 10" because Ubuntu is awesome and therefore the wallpaper should reflect this awesomeness.
> 
> Actual Results:
> 
> - My eyes ! They're melting !
  
> - The 10 is not perfect with this wallpaper
  
> - MacOS X "Snow Leopard" and Windows 7 have better default wallpapers
  
> - Does not inspire awe
  
> - No one likes it, I haven't found any positive feedback on this wallpaper
> 
> Build Date & Platform:
>
