Uh-huh. Riiight. Maybe he didn&#8217;t look at the image.

Well, he got a pretty descriptive [bug report][3]{#aptureLink_BN6zPL2Fq3}, courtesy [Matthieu][4]{#aptureLink_8svxK8IXJc}. Hilarious.

> 
> Default Ubuntu wallpaper is not a wallpaper for an OS which aims to be the best looking OS on the planet.
> 
> Steps to Reproduce:
> 
> Install or upgrade Ubuntu 10.10
> 
> Expected Results:
> 
> Expecting a cool and awesome looking wallpaper for &#8220;the perfect 10&#8221; because Ubuntu is awesome and therefore the wallpaper should reflect this awesomeness.
> 
> Actual Results:
> 
> &#8211; My eyes ! They&#8217;re melting !
  
> &#8211; The 10 is not perfect with this wallpaper
  
> &#8211; MacOS X &#8220;Snow Leopard&#8221; and Windows 7 have better default wallpapers
  
> &#8211; Does not inspire awe
  
> &#8211; No one likes it, I haven&#8217;t found any positive feedback on this wallpaper
> 
> Build Date & Platform:
> 
> Up to date Ubuntu 10.10
