In my previous posts, I&#8217;d mentioned about [Canonical&#8217;s Ship It program][1], which sends Ubuntu disc for free to your door step, [Fedora&#8217;s Free Media program][2], which ships Fedora media wherever you it shipped. .I&#8217;d also [mentioned][1] Oracle sending their Oracle Unbreakable Linux for free(though to date I haven&#8217;t received them).Â 

Now, Sun Microsystems joins the list of vendors offering free media. Head over to [this page][3] and fill in the form and request for your OpenSolaris CD.
  
Thanks, [Arun aka mixdev][4]
