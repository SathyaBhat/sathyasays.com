![Grand Theft Auto 5 collector's editions announced, to release in India][1]

Rockstar Games today revealed two special editions for Grand Theft Auto 5, both of which will be available in India.

The standard edition will only contain the game and is (tentatively) priced at Rs 2,799, but here&rsquo;s what will be available in the other two editions:

**Special Edition**

  * Retail copy of Grand Theft Auto V
  * Collectible SteelBook with exclusive artwork: Custom colour and metallic treatments bring out the detail of the artwork of Michael, Trevor and Franklin created exclusively for this SteelBook.
  * Blueprint map: Additional 21.5&#8243; x 26.75&#8243; map displays a blueprint view of Los Santos and Blaine County. Cryptic markings indicate locations for fast cash and other points of interest.
  * Special ability boost: Michael, Franklin and Trevor each have a unique special ability. With this boost, the special ability bar will generate 25 per cent faster.
  * Stunt plane trials: Single-player trials let you take on additional aerial challenges.
  * Bonus outfits, tattoos and more: Michael, Franklin and Trevor get bonus outfits, character-specific tattoos, and special deals from shopkeepers.
  * Additional weapons: When visiting Ammunation stores in single player, merchants will have special weapons in their inventory available for free: the Pistol .50, Bullpup Shotgun and melee Hammer.

**Collector&#8217;s Edition**

  * Comes packaged in a premium outer box featuring a foil-embossed Grand Theft Auto 5 logo on the top, finished with a matte, scuff-resistant film lamination.
  * GTA5 security deposit bag with logo key: Custom 10.75&#8243; x 8.5&#8243; money bag features a pop-up style lock and laser cut logo key. The reverse side features a pressed Rockstar Games logo on the security mount with a framed ID window.
  * GTA5 New Era 9FIFTY Snapback Cap: This exclusive New Era 9FIFTY cap features an embroidered Los Santos logo on the front, a stitched, black Rockstar Games logo on the wearer&#8217;s left side, a Grand Theft Auto &#8216;V&#8217; logo applique on the opposite side, and snapback closure for an adjustable fit.
  * Custom characters for online: Classic Grand Theft Auto characters to use within the Grand Theft Auto Online Character Creation System.
  * Unique vehicles and garage property: Instantly receive a garage to store custom vehicles. In single-player, the garage will be stocked with the 1930s style Hotknife hotrod and the CarbonRS sports bike. In Grand Theft Auto Online, players will get the high-end Khamelion electric car.
  * All contents of Special Edition.

Prices for the Special Edition and Collector&rsquo;s Edition haven&rsquo;t yet been announced, but considering the latter&rsquo;s $150 price tag internationally, we&rsquo;d expect something in the Rs 10,000 region.

Grand Theft Auto 5 is scheduled for release on 17th September for Xbox 360 and PS3.
