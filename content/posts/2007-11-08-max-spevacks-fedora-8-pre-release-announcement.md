Max Spevack, Fedora&#8217;s Project Leader speaks about the release of Fedora 8 at the [Mailing List
  
][1] 

On Thursday November 8th (about 3:00 PM GMT), Fedora 8 will go live to the world, and you will be able to download it at [http://fedoraproject.org][2]

The bits are all finalized, the mirrors are synced, and the torrents are primed. But until we flip the switch, you will have to tide yourself over with this &#8212; my personal Fedora 8 release announcement.

Fortunately, it&#8217;s pretty long, so if you read it all, Fedora 8 might be released by the time you have finished!

One of the goals that we specifically chose for Fedora 8 was to use it as the release that gets us back on track in terms of predictability. We picked two dates &#8212; Halloween and May Day &#8212; that are 6 months apart, and for the foreseeable future it is Fedora&#8217;s goal to release as close to those two dates as possible.

Fedora 7 was released on May 31st. Fedora 8 arrives on November 8th.

In the software world, getting within one week of a date that was picked six months earlier is considered successful, and I think that everyone in our development and contributor community should be proud of the fact that we put together a quality release that includes lots of new features in exactly 23 weeks.
  
Fedora 7 and Fedora 8 need to be thought of together in that context &#8212; the community&#8217;s goals and priorities being paramount. The overarching goal for both of these releases has been in the realm of custom spins.

We debuted this model in Fedora 7 with pungi, livecd-creator, and revisor. Fedora 8 has expanded this further, and has proven the hypothesis of &#8220;if we give people the tools, they will come&#8221;.

Fedora 8 brings with it a developer spin, a games spin, and an electronic lab spin, in addition to the GNOME and KDE desktop spins that were first part of Fedora 7.

Additionally, we have seen organizations like Creative Commons use the Fedora build tools in the past year as the basis for their own custom Linux projects, built using Fedora as its foundation.

&#8212;-

There are a tremendous number of new features in Fedora 8 &#8212; too many for me to list here. But there is an excellent release summary on the Fedora Project wiki that I encourage you to read if you want more specifics about Fedora 8.
