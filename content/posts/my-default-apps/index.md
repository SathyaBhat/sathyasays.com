summary: Looking to find an alternative to Google Maps Timeline? OwnTracks is a self-hosted location history tracker and might be a decent alternative to Google Maps Timeline.

You may have seen a bunch of nice people posting a list of their “default apps” on their respective blogs. I had meant to do a 2023 edition of this, but never got around it — my posting frequency in general on this blog was quite low in 2024. I’m determined to change that in 2025, so I plan to post a lot more frequently on Nuclear Bits starting today. Here’s my list of default apps that I used in 2024. A detailed wrirteup of the software and apps I use is available on the ‘Stuff I Use‘ page.

Sidenote: The App Defaults website that Robb has put up is turning into a really cool place to discover personal blogs of very interesting people. I’ve already added RSS feeds of over two dozen of them to my Reeder lists, and I urge you to go take a look.
