First up, if you haven&#8217;t read my previous post, [go read it!][1]

Now, after you&#8217;ve read the post, you people can get an idea as to how pissed off and frustrated I was. The following day, ie, Tuesday, I was determined to finish off the work come no matter what! So armed with my Cheque book, 2 pens(yeah, 2, just in case any one ran out of ink!). Left my Office at 5.45pm this day, as I&#8217;d decided to goto the Adyar branch. First up had to goto ATM as I had absolutely no cash. Thankfully, ICICI ATM is just opposite to the bus stop. After collecting the cash, I was wondering if I&#8217;d be as lucky as the previous day(well, in terms of gettings Share autos, you know!) and just as I was thinking about it a share auto comes along, but it was empty! Nevertheless I stop the auto, and tell him him &#8220;Adyar-ICICI Bank&#8221;.

<!--more-->

The auto driver replies-&#8220;Yes, saar! Only Rs. 80 Saar!&#8221;!! I was like :!: and politely asked him to move along. Right after that the bus comes. And I enter the bus(deluxe bus :P yaaay!!) and the bus chugs along. At Thiruvanmiyuur, the traffice comes to a stand-still(as always!) and I had a bright idea. Thought to my self &#8220;Might as well go walking, anyways the distance isn&#8217;t much&#8221;. Result: BAD IDEA. What I thought was a &#8220;short distance&#8221; turned out to be a 50-minute(yeah, that&#8217;s right! 50 NOT 15) walk. By the time I reached the Bank, it was 6:50, I was all tired but the bank was still open(ICICI works from 8-8, yaay for me). I take out a toen, wait another 10 minutes for my turn, and then, guess what? After another about 30 minutes, I&#8217;m done!! The DD was in my hands!! Step 1 was complete. Next step was to courier it. Asked the Security Guard if there&#8217;s a nearby Courier centre, he directs me to a nearby(meaning 15 minute walk) outlet. The shop had &#8220;The Professional Couriers&#8221; board, so I was pretty happy since Dell prefers &#8220;The Professional Couriers&#8221; and I&#8217;ve had good experiences with them. But, but(as always), it turns out that the board was just that&#8211;a board! :| The shop was an agent of some PAFEX couriers(which I later come to know that is a Licensee of FedEx). So as of now, I&#8217;ve despatched the DD. The agent told me that the consignment should reach Bangalore by tomorrow. So fingers crossed till then! :|
