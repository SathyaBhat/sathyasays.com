      Well, it was bound to happen. Can't wait for whiners to bitch and sa Codies are money grabbers because they didn't add this view in the retail game &#8211; because you know &#8211; the current cockpit view is anything but complete

PC people really are clever and dedicated folks. If they&#8217;re not inventing new and grotesque ways to contort the G-Man&#8217;s face and limbs, they&#8217;re making mods for games that have only been out for a few hours. Codemasters didn&#8217;t include cockpit views in their [enjoyably silly][2] racing-game-with-a-plot, [GRID 2][3]. The reason given was that only 5% of people who played the original ever used the in-car cams and &#8220;they are expensive to run due to the requirement for high-resolution interior textures which are seen close-up and require a considerable amount of in-game memory (to store) and processing (to render).&#8221; [Intelligent sorts have already modded the game][4], adding cockpit views, and, lo, the interiors are indeed low resolution, but there are already folks working to sharpen the whole thing up. Video under the hood.
