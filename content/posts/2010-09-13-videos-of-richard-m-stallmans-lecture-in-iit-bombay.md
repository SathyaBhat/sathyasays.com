Richard M Stallman was in Bombay [recently][1]{#aptureLink_ezdj5ZajHB}, as I found when [Aditya Sengupta][2]{#aptureLink_G3xUyHaQjg} tweeted [if anyone had questions][3]{#aptureLink_ISHBjxViqn} for him. I asked Sengupta if there any plans to record the sessions and upload them, Sengupta said he&#8217;d have to check and come back. Few days after the event, Sengupta sent me an @reply saying that the videos had been uploaded, so thought I&#8217;ll post it here for easy reference.
