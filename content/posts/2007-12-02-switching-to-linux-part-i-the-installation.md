_We have already told you why you need to shift to linux now we tell you how to shift to it_
  
We have choosen Ubuntu as our distro. Why?
  
Well Ubuntu is the one, our saviour, our salvation&#8230;&#8230;..
  
Ok coming back to the topic well Ubuntu is the most user friendly distro I have come across. Though Xubuntu is more user friendly due to its minimalistic nature it will take more of your precious time.

### The Installation

All the buntu&#8217;s follow the simple 7-step installation procedure.
  
One you go through the steps you will find that there is really no need for this guide but I&#8217;ve run out of ideas for articles so I thought of doing this ;).

<!--more-->

 **Step-I**
  
Select the installer language. Yes thats right an whole step dedicated to selecting the language.
  
 **Step-II**
  
Select your region. This ones rather innovative. It gives you a map with different time zones and you just have to click the time zone. As simple as that.
  
 **Step-III**
  
Select your keyboard layout. Thats 3 simple things untill now. This step even provides you a sand box to test your keyboard.
  
 **Step-IV**
  
Oh-God its the partioner. Well one should actually say thank god for this partioner(rather thank the developer). The pationing is very simple and even lets you resize your partions.
  
 **Step-V**
  
Migrating Agent. In this step Ubuntu scans for user accounts from other Operating Systems installed in your hard drive and asks if you want to migrate those accounts.
  
 **Step-VI**
  
Setup a User. Here you create an user and set up the password.
  
 **Step-VII**
  
Confirm installation.
  
and Ubuntu gets installed within 15-20 minutes. Thats righti it&#8217;s so simple, anyone can install ubuntu.
