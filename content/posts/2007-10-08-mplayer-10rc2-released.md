<font size="2">It&#8217;s been a while, but we are still around and have decided that it&#8217;s time to funnel our steady stream of daily changes into a release again.</p> 

<p>
  One main source of improvements has, as always, been FFmpeg, which added support for several new video and audio codecs along with speedups and massive code cleanups.
</p>

<p>
  MPlayer now supports Real RTSP authentication and the libnemesi streaming library as an alternative to live555. Also, many QuickTime over RTSP streams can now be played. There have been various improvements to TV streaming, Intel Mac support should be complete.
</p>

<p>
  Support for VC-1 in MPEG-TS and MPEG-PS will make many HDTV streams work. Blu-ray or HD-DVD playback is not possible yet, but MPlayer can play the EVO files after they have been decrypted.
</p>

<p>
  MPlayer now assumes square pixels as found on LCD panels. If the video on your monitor appears squished or stretched please use &#8216;-monitoraspect 4:3&#8217; to get back the previous behavior.
