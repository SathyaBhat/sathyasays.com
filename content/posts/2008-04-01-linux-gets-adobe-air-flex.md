People had been demanding for a Linux version of Adobe AIR. Now now finally, Adobe has joined Linux Foundation and has announced the pre-release alpha version of Adobe AIR for Linux. The pre-release alpha version can be downloaded fromÂ  <a href="https://www.adobe.com/go/airlinux" target="_blank">Adobe Labs</a>.

Adobe Labs also updated an alpha version of <a href="https://www.adobe.com/go/flexbuilder_linux" target="_blank">Adobe Flex Builder 3 for Linux</a> software is also available on Adobe Labs today, which adds support for creating applications that run on Adobe AIR. The combination of Flex, Adobe AIR and Adobe Flash Player 9 for Linux comprises a well supported, and enables developers to build, debug and deploy RIAs entirely on Linux, and across browsers and desktops.

Flex, Adobe AIR and Adobe Flash Player are key elements of the Adobe technology platform. Flex is a free, open source framework for building highly interactive, expressive RIAs that can be deployed on the desktop with Adobe AIR, or in the browser with Adobe Flash Player.

The pre-release alpha version of Adobe AIR for Linux is available immediately in English as a free download from <a href="https://www.adobe.com/go/airlinux" target="_blank">Adobe Labs</a>.

The final version of Adobe AIR for Linux is expected later this year and will be available in other languages.

Additionally, the update to <a href="https://www.adobe.com/go/flexbuilder_linux" target="_blank">Adobe Flex Builder 3 for Linux alpha</a> is freely available in English from Adobe Labs.
