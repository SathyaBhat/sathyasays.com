One of [CHIP-India&#8217;s][1] [forum][2] members, Sujith Poojari had posted a link to 25 Top 3D games for Linux. Some of them I&#8217;ve already played like Armagetron Advanced, BZFlag, Sauerbraten, Scorched 3D, TORCS while some others unknown to me, such as Racer(been playing it recently, good graphics! controls need refinement though), PlaneShift etc. So enjoy these games and have a blast!

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://www.armagetronad.net/"><span style="font-weight: bold">Armagetron Advanced</span></a>
</p>

Armagetron is a <span style="font-style: italic">multiplayer game</span> in 3d that attempts to emulate and expand on the lightcycle sequence from the movie Tron. It&#8217;s an old school arcade game slung into the 21st century. Highlights include a customizable playing arena, HUD, unique graphics, and AI bots. For the more advanced player there are <span style="font-style: italic">new game modes</span> and a wide variety of physics settings to tweak as well.

  <a href="https://bzflag.org/"><span style="font-weight: bold">BZFlag</span></a>
</p>

<a href="https://bzflag.org/" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 450px;" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3290/2814471948_6468c0bb91_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

BZFlag is a <span style="font-style: italic">free online multiplayer</span> cross-platform open source 3D tank battle game. The name originates from &#8220;Battle Zone capture the Flag&#8221;. It runs on Irix, Linux, BSD, Windows, Mac OS X, and many other platforms. It&#8217;s one of the most popular <span style="font-style: italic">open source games</span> ever on Silicon Graphics machines and continues to be developed and improved to this day.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://sauerbraten.org/"><span style="font-weight: bold">Cube 2 &#8220;Sauerbraten&#8221;</span></a>
</p>

<a href="https://sauerbraten.org/" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 450px;" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3012/2814501744_987e1b38aa_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

Free single and <span style="font-style: italic">multiplayer first person shooter game</span> with some satisfying fast oldskool gameplay. A large variety of gameplay modes from classic SP to fast 1 on 1 MP and objective based teamplay, with a great variety of original maps to play on.

Level editing has never been so much fun: a press of a key allows you to modify the geometry / textures / entities in-game, on the fly. Even more novel, you can make maps together with others online, in the unique &#8220;coop edit&#8221; mode.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://cubeengine.com/"><span style="font-weight: bold">Cube</span></a>
</p>

Cube is the original game that started it all. Though it has been surpassed in almost every way by Cube 2, it is a game in its own right. Most importantly, it comes with over 100 maps, most of which are not available in Cube 2, with extensive single and multiplayer content.

Cube is also smaller in every way, in download, in hardware requirements (runs well on older video cards!), and in source code (the absolutely tiny code base is a very easy start for those wishing to experiment).

It also has some unique engine features such as the high precision dynamic occlusion culling, and its heighfield based level format.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://digitalpaint.planetquake.gamespy.com/files/"><span style="font-weight: bold">Digital Paint&#8217;s Paintball 2.0</span></a>

FlightGear Flight Simulator project is an open-source, multi-platform, cooperative flight simulator development project. Source code for the entire project is available and licensed under the GNU General Public License.

The goal of the FlightGear project is to create a <span style="font-style: italic">sophisticated flight simulator</span> framework for use in research or academic environments, for the development and pursuit of other interesting flight simulation ideas, and as an end-user application.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://fretsonfire.sourceforge.net/"><span style="font-weight: bold">Frets On Fire</span></a>
</p>

<a href="https://fretsonfire.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 450px;" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3133/2813634833_1b18124430_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

Winner of the Assembly Demo Party 2006, Frets on Fire is a music video game that uses the keyboard to play along with scrolling on-screen musical notes to complete a song. The player has to imagine the keyboard as a guitar and pick it up to play. One hand will be used to press the ‘frets’ (F1 to F5) and another will be used to press the ‘picks’ (Shift or Enter). Colored markers that appears are to be played by pressing ‘frets’ of the correct color and ‘picks’ at the correct moment. There are also song editors and tutorials featured in the game. This game is really addictive.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gillo"><span style="font-weight: bold">Gillo</span></a>
</p>

Two player game in a 3D ellipsoid playground. Players are cars with a magnetic director, able to attract or reject a ball in order to throw it through a goal placed in the center of the playing field. It sounds easy&#8230; but remember that reality is fuzzy!

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://www.glest.org/en/index.html"><span style="font-weight: bold">Glest</span></a>
</p>

<a href="https://www.glest.org/en/index.html" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 450px;" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3085/2814671090_62cf1d32ff_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

Glest is a free 3D <span style="font-style: italic">real time strategy game</span>, available for several operating systems.

The core game allows the player to take control of two completely different factions: Tech, which is mainly composed of warriors and mechanical devices, and Magic, that prefers mages and summoned creatures in the battlefield.

Very cool and complete warcraft-like strategy game, pity there&#8217;s no multiplayer yet.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://maniadrive.raydium.org/"><span style="font-weight: bold">ManiaDrive</span></a>
</p>

<a href="https://maniadrive.raydium.org/" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 450px;" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3048/2814664252_1240452295_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

ManiaDrive is a free clone of Trackmania, the great game from Nadéo studio, and is an arcade car game on acrobatic tracks, with a quick and nervous gameplay (tracks almost never exceed one minute), and features a network mode, as the original. Lots of crazy driving involved.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://icculus.org/neverball/"><span style="font-weight: bold">Neverball / Neverputt</span></a>
</p>

<a href="https://icculus.org/neverball/" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 450px;" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3153/2814751526_1b12ac195f_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

Tilt the floor to roll a ball through an obstacle course before time runs out. Neverball is part puzzle game, part action game, and entirely a <span style="font-style: italic">test of skill</span>.

Neverputt is a hot-seat multiplayer miniature golf game using the physics and graphics of Neverball. Current version includes 75 Neverball levels and 62 Neverputt levels.

Neverball and Neverputt are known to run under Linux, Win2K/XP, FreeBSD, and OSX. Hardware accelerated OpenGL is required. A 500MHz processor is recommended.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://www.planeshift.it/"><span style="font-weight: bold">Planeshift</span></a>
</p>

PlaneShift is a <span style="font-style: italic">Role Playing Game</span> immersed into a 3D virtual fantasy world which is fully free to play. Fully free means you will have no surprises of premium content which will limit your gameplay or unbalance the game. There are no limitations in skills, ranks, abilities, items you can gain with your free account. There are no time limits or additional constraints.

The virtual world is persistent, and this means you can connect to it at any hour of the day and you will always find players and NPCs wandering the realms. You will be able to disconnect and reconnect again as many times as you like because your character is stored on the server, so you will never have to worry about saving the game. A player can start from humble

beginnings and advance to greatness in whatever path they may choose.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://www.racer.nl/"><span style="font-weight: bold">Racer</span></a>
</p>

<a href="https://www.racer.nl/" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 450px;" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2277/2814628996_ab3eca91b2_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

Racer is a free cross-platform car simulation project (for non-commercial use), using professional car physics to achieve a realistic feeling and an excellent render engine for graphical realism. Cars, tracks and such can be created relatively easy (compared to other, more closed, driving simulations). The 3D, physics and other file formats are documented. Editors and support programs are also available to get a very customizable and expandable simulator. OpenGL is used for rendering.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://savage2.s2games.com/"><span style="font-weight: bold">Savage 2: A Tortured Soul</span></a>
</p>

<a href="https://savage2.s2games.com/" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 450px;" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3283/2813808075_4f000b9ce2_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

Savage 2: A Tortured Soul is a fast paced strategy shooter that takes team based game play to another level. Each match is a war for dominance where two teams of 5 to 32 players attempt to destroy each other. It will take more than guns to finish the job. Assume your position as a fighter, armed with swords, guns, and magic; or take the field as a support character that

builds, heals, and resurrects fallen comrades.

Feel like bringing out the big stick? Become a siege unit like the Behemoth (a huge animal biped descendant of elephants that takes down buildings using an uprooted tree) or the battering ram to destroy enemy buildings. Always thought you were a natural born leader? Take control as the leader of the action, the

commander, who builds, researches, expands, and tactically strategizes your team&#8217;s efforts.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://www.scorched3d.co.uk/"><span style="font-weight: bold">Scorched 3D</span></a>
</p>

<a href="https://www.scorched3d.co.uk/" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 450px;" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3070/2813810999_6bb63a3af3_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

Scorched 3D is a 100% free turn-based artillery game modeled after the classic DOS game Scorched Earth ‘The Mother Of All Games’. Operatable across all operating systems. What started as a 3D landscape generator has now become a cool 3D game that requires skills to master. Players are supposed to take turns homing in to hit the target by adjusting the angle, rotation, power and a weapon of choice every other turn. Hits and kills will generate income for you to buy better weapons and items. Note that items are as important as weapons.

Notable features include iron sights aiming (no crosshair), multi layer object penetration, letterbox / wide screen view modes, lag compensation, client side bullet prediction and support for PunkBuster, the anti cheat software.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://www.urbanterror.net/"><span style="font-weight: bold">Urban Terror</span></a>
</p>

Urban Terror could best be described as a Hollywood tactical shooter; it is realism based to a certain extent (environments/weapons/player models), but also goes by the motto &#8220;fun over realism&#8221; (fast gameplay and lots of action). This combination of reality and action results in a very unique, enjoyable and addictive game.

Urban Terror is available for Windows, Linux and Macintosh. The current version of Urban Terror is 4.0. Currently working on 4.1.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://vdrift.net/"><span style="font-weight: bold">VDrift</span></a>

Warzone 2100 is a real-time strategy game, developed by Pumpkin Studios and published by Eidos-Interactive. Although comparable to other 3D RTS games, it does contain some features that are unique. These include various radar technologies, a greater focus on artillery and counter-battery technologies, as well as a different vehicle design method.

Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory was originally planned as an add-on for Return to Castle Wolfenstein, but soon became it&#8217;s own game, a separate entity with full single player, multiplayer, AI opponents and teammates! Well that didn&#8217;t happen and what we got, while less than planned, is amazing&#8230;and free!

Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory is a free, stand-alone multiplayer only product, which means it&#8217;s for online play only, but all you need is what you download. You do not need anything else to play Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, than what you download for free. No Return to Castle Wolfenstein, no additional file packages or monthly charges, just one phat lump of action.
