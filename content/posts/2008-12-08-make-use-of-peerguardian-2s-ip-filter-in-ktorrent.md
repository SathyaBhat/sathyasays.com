PeerGuardian 2, is an awesome IP filtering software. Though its FOSS, it there isn&#8217;t a Linux port of it yet. But don&#8217;t worry, if you&#8217;re using KTorrent, you can make use of PeerGuardian&#8217;s filters.  Let me show how you can do so.

<!--more-->

Launch KTorrent. Click on On Settings -> Configure KTorrent . Click on Plugins and ensure that IP FIlter is checked

![Ktorrent settings][1]

Now Click on Apply. Next on the sidebar, scroll down and click on IP Filter. Click on the checkbox next to &#8220;Use PeerGuardian Filter&#8221;. Next just click on Download/Convert. It might take a minute or two for the list to be loaded and converted to a format KTorrent can understand.

![IP-Filter][2]

Next Click on Apply and OK. There you go, you&#8217;re done. KTorrent now will make use of PeerGuardian&#8217;s filters.
