It gives me great pleasure to announce that my good friend, [Kunal Gautam][1] has launched a blog on Linux, &#8220;[Linux For All &#8211; Making Linux usable for all from newbies to techies][2]&#8220;. Kunal is a gem of a person, is well versed in all the latest techonologic trends and I&#8217;m proud to say that he is one of the persons who I&#8217;ve convinced to make a shift from Windows to Linux and is extremely happy with it. Kunal, now is doing a course in [RHCE][3] and aims to be a Linux System Admin in due course of time.

So for those people who drop by my blog, do pay a visit to his blog.

Thanks :)
