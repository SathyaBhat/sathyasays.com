### [Blizzard Rolling Out Patch 1.0.5 For Diablo III, Brings in New Events &rarr;][1]

> Along with lots of bug fixes, the patch brings in two new types of Gameplay events – the Infernal Machine and Monster Power.

tl;dr version:

  * Monster Power increases monster health difficulty & health from 100% to OMFG-are-you-nuts!?!? levels
  * Infernal Machine brings in not just one, but two Bosses.

If Ghom wasn&#8217;t bad enough &#8211; I shudder at the thought of going against Rakanoth **and **Ghom simultaneously. I have no freakin&#8217; idea how the Monk&#8217;s going to cope up with Ghom&#8217;s gas attack and Rakanoth&#8217;s shielding :-\.

It&#8217;ll take some time before I can even think of Infernal machine &#8211; considering that the components required for building Infernal Machine are dropped only in Inferno :-|.

Monster Power, on the other hand &#8211; gotta check it out. Looks fairly balanced, only after trying it out can say how it feels like.
