  Thankfully, Firefox&#8217;s support for theme and the immense community out there meant I was able to get a fantastic theme, which makes Firefox look like a native KDE4 application (well, almost!).

  You can download KDE4 + Firefox 3 theme from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7574">here</a>, though do note that it is an experimental add-on and hence you will need a Mozilla account. Its  well worth registering though, have a look at Firefox after applying the theme.
