Ubuntu Live is a vibrant and important gathering of IT professionals, government and business leaders, educators, community leaders, enterprise and business users. The conference brings together the people who deploy and manage Ubuntu in organizations, companies offering services and solutions based on Ubuntu, customers of those services, users of Ubuntu, and the folks who build Ubuntu and other key open source software.

The two day event will allow participants to share their Ubuntu experiences, learn from each other, and catch up with the latest developments from Ubuntu, our partners, and the free software and open source ecosystem. Ubuntu Live is **the** meeting place for enterprise users and community developers to come together to exchange ideas and discuss projects face to face.

The Ubuntu Live program committee is now accepting proposals to lead sessions, panel discussions, and demos at the 2008 edition of Ubuntu Live. How are you taking Ubuntu further? Are you a guru using Ubuntu in unexpected ways? An entrepreneur launching a business with Ubuntu? An educator or researcher helping an underserved community thrive with Edubuntu? Are you a programmer, trainer, or system administrator with techniques or best practices to share? If so, [submit a proposal][1] to speak **by February 4, 2008**.

Co-presented by O&#8217;Reilly Media and <a href="http://www.canonical.com/" target="_blank" title="Opens link in a new browser window.">Canonical</a>, Ltd., the commercial sponsor of Ubuntu, Ubuntu Live is conveniently co-located with the O&#8217;Reilly Open Source Convention (OSCON) event, thus making Portland, Oregon the place to be during the week of July 21.

Wish there would be something similar here. It&#8217;s be great the Linux movement and for OSS in general. Event managers, are you listening?

For those planning to go for the Convention, [here][2]&#8216;s more details
