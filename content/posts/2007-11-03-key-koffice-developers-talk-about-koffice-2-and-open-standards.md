[KOffice][1], the office suite built on KDE technology and in the KDE Communtiy has [recently][2] gotten a lot of press, but is still often underrepresented. In this interview, some key KOffice developers tell us about the recent progress of KDE&#8217;s Office suite, about Open Standards and how KOffice plays an active role in bringing Freedom to users. We have talked to Boudewijn Rempt, developer of Krita, core KOffice contributor and KOffice release manager, as well as to David Faure who has been taking part in the [OASIS][3], the organization that is responsible for advancing the OpenDocument (ODF) standard.
  
David Faure says:

> We&#8217;re taking part in the OASIS because we truly believe in Open Standards. KOffice standardises on OpenDocument. Free Software and open standards are a perfect match and the way to move forward for a society to ensure vendor-independent access to its data. We&#8217;re actively participating in the OASIS since it matches our value, and we believe that one strong standard is in the best interest of our users.

Boudewijn Rempt gives us an overview over what&#8217;s happening in the KOffice community.
