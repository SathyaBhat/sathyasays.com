Novell have relaunched the [Linux Driver Project][1] by dedicating well-known kernel developer Greg KH to [work on the project full-time][2]. Greg KH writes: &#8216;My employer, Novell, has modified my position to now allow me to work full time on this project. Namely getting more new Linux kernel drivers written, for free, for any company that so desires. And to help manage all of the developers and project managers who want to help out&#8230;They really care about helping make Linux support as many devices as possible, with fully open-source drivers.'&#8221;
