Studies done by a prestigious think tank in Silicon Valley have identified the most common behavioral changes in people who have switched to Linux. They were nice enough to share their information with us. According to them, these are the ten most side effects offrequent of Linux use with us.

**Number 10:** You start talking about &#8216;killing&#8217; programs instead of forcing them to quit

**Number 9:** You keep reminding yourself that you don&#8217;t have to save your work every five minutes

**Number 8:** You start substituting C for K in your normal writing (_Did you know that Pizarro konquered the Inkas?_)

**Number 7:** You talk your grandmother into open-sourcing her secret cookie recipe

**Number 6:** People give you strange looks when you brag about your uptime

**Number 5:** You cause Bill Gates&#8217; fortune to decrease by 0.0000001 percent

**Number 4:** The only viruses that bother you are the ones that cause the flu

**Number 3:** The blue screen of death only appears to you in nightmares

**Number 2:** You actually get some serious work done

**And the number 1 side effect of switching to Linux is:**
  
Your problems meeting members of the opposite sex disappear
