I love Unity, especially the lens feature. While going through the Ubuntu store, found this neat little lens for initiating an SSH connection.

  The lens parses your ~/.ssh/known_hosts & ~/.ssh/config files and provides you with a list of servers that you can connect to. Just install the lens, logout & login back to your desktop and you're good to go.

  To search, just bring up Unity dash by hitting the Super (aka Windows) key, type either the username or host and just hit enter to initiate the connection.

  Pretty slick. Install it by searching for SSH Search Lens in Ubuntu store or by clicking <a title="Unity Lens SSH Search" href="https://apt.ubuntu.com/p/unity-lens-sshsearch">here</a>. Oh, the notes mention you'll need Oneiric & above - so keep that in mind.
