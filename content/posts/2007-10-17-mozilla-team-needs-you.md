[Alexander Sack][1] and the [Mozilla Team][2] are working on updated Firefox packages for **Dapper**, **Edgy** and **Feisty** releases and they need YOU to test them! To help you help them, a special [QA report page][3] has been created. This Firefox testing effort is a great way to contribute to Ubuntu and is important for helping Ubuntu to raise the quality of every release. Testing will take just a few minutes:
