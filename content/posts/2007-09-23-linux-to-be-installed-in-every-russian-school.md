**Russian OS**(yup, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s going to be called, what a &#8220;awesome&#8221; name) is to be installed on every school computer in Russia by 2009. Furthermore, every pupil will get the opportunity to operate the applied software produced in Russia, Leonid Reiman, acting Minister of Communication stated at a press conference. Experts and market participants consider the terms within which software is to be developed quite reasonable. According to Mr. Reiman, that might significantly reduce Russian dependence on foreign software.

Leonid Reiman, RF acting Minister of Communication states Russian OS and application program package development is of vital importance, as that might significantly reduce dependence of Russia on foreign software. “In 2008 Russian software is to be tested in three pilot regions, i.e. Tomsk region, Perm Regions and Republic of Tatarstan. While by 2009 domestic software is to be installed on every school computer”, &#8211; Leonid Reiman says.

The Ministry of Communication Press Service explains the Ministry plans to install Russian OS and alternative program package in every Russian school. The dates to carry out tenders for OS development have not been announced yet, but the tenders are to be held in the near future, the Ministry of Communication informs.
