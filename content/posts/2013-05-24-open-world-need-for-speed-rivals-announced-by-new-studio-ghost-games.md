        <p>
          The Need for Speed franchise is sticking with its successful open-world, cops-vs-racers formula with Need for Speed: Rivals.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Rivals is an action-racer being developed by EA&rsquo;s new studio Ghost Games, which is comprised of talent from Bizzare and Blackrock, as well as the lead designer of Far Cry 3. Criterion will assist development.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The game will be powered by the Frostbite 3 engine and will allow players to take the wheel as either cops or racers, each with their own challenges. Cars will be equipped with pursuit and evasion tech, such as turbo boosts, jammers and EMPs.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Players will also be able to personalise and customise their cars with paintjobs, custom license plates, liveries, decals, rims, and performance upgrades.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Rivals will welcome back Ferrari to the NFS franchise after a seven-year absence, and will feature the Italian car manufacturer&rsquo;s latest model, the F12berlinetta.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          At the centre of Rivals is its new AllDrive feature, which aims to blur the lines between single and multiplayer by allowing players to seamlessly transition from playing alone to playing with friends.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          &lsquo;Players will have to keep one eye on their rearview mirror as friends will be able to enter and exit races on-the-fly, creating a world where no two events will ever be the same.&rsquo;
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Need for Speed: Rivals arrives on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 on 19<sup>th</sup> November, with Xbox One and PS4 versions hitting stores later this year. Check out the teaser below.
