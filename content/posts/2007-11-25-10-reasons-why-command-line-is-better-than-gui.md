&#8220;Penguin Pete&#8221; gives 10 reasons as to why the command line is far better than GUI. And yeah, I do agree with him. Something as simple as installing as application is a lot easier! I mean c&#8217;mon tell me, which is better, telling someone to type &#8220;sudo apt-get install xxx&#8221; or &#8220;Click on the Button, Click on system, click on utilities, click on install&#8221; etc. Wouldn&#8217;t you agree? I prefer the command line way&#8211;not because it&#8217;s geeky, because it saves you a lot of time!

Here&#8217;s his reasons:

  * Keying is faster than mousing.
  * It&#8217;s easier to both give and get help.
  * Repetitive stress injury comes from the mouse, not the keyboard.
  * Commands are standard where GUIs are not.
  * Commands are more powerful.

<!--more-->

  *  You can automate commands.
  *  Commands are easier to remember than clicks.
  * GUIs are always changing.
  * Commands are more error-safe.
  * You have to type to use a computer anyways
