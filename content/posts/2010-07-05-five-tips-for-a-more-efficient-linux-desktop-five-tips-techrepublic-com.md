> 1: The pager
> 
> I am always shocked at how few people actually use the Linux pager. It’s been around forever and has always served the same functionality — it offers the user multiple desktops to keep the desktop better organized. I employ the pager like this: With four workspaces, I dedicate each workspace to a different use. My layout looks like this:
> 
> * Desktop 1 is for networking tools.
> 
> * Desktop 2 is for writing/office tools.
> 
> * Desktop 3 is for graphics or video.
> 
> * Desktop 4 is for miscellaneous items.
> 
> This layout pretty much covers it for me. I’m sure you could find a four-desktop scheme that would better suit your needs.
