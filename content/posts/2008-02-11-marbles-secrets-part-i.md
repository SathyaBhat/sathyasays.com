If you&#8217;ve ever followed KDE 4 development then you&#8217;ve probably heard about Marble. Marble is a virtual globe which displays the earth. So Marble can be used as a nice digital replacement for your desktop globe at home where you can look up places.

But wait! There&#8217;s more to it: Actually these days Marble can also display flat maps (thanks to Carlos Licea), can show different &#8220;map themes&#8221; and can serve as a Qt4-widget as well as an application! This means that as a programmer you can use Marble in your very own project as a map widget (License: LGPL). _Marble was designed to run on any device and on any operating system supported by Qt4 without any further requirements._ You can download the latest version of Marble together with KDE 4.0.1 [here][1] (It&#8217;s part of the KDE-EDU module).

**How Marble stores texture data**

If you start Marble you might realize that the startup time is pretty good: It usually takes maybe 2-5 secs to start Marble (and we are working on improving that dramatically). If you zoom into the earth you might notice that Marble doesn&#8217;t get slower while zooming in. Looking at the amount of memory being used up you will also see that memory numbers don&#8217;t change either. _No matter how much you zoom in it&#8217;s as little as 65-100MB_ which is pretty lean compared to other virtual globes.
  
Among other concepts this is being accomplished by loading the map piece by piece. Marble uses a concept that is very popular among virtual globes: _Quadtiles_.
