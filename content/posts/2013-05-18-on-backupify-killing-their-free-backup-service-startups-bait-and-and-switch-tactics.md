Long ago <a href="http://blog.backupify.com/2009/12/16/backup-your-online-accounts-for-free/" target="_blank">when Backupify said they were going to offer their service for free</a>, I knew it was too good to be true and weren&#8217;t going to last long. Fast forward today, they mention they&#8217;re going to not only kill their free twitter backup service, but also wipe out data of their existing free users.

> Dear Customer,

Yeah, let me just quote from their blog when they announced their free service:

> If you sign up during this time period, you get unlimited storage, for free. **You get an account that is not a free trial, not free for a limited time, free forever**.

Free forever, eh? Right. This is what annoys the fuck out of me. Why in the world do you promise shit you you can&#8217;t keep? Why the fuck do you have to sugarcoat and provide false promises? All in the name of &#8220;gaining traction&#8221;.

These services are driving me up the wall with their bait and switch tactics. Bait users with their free tactics, gain &#8220;traction&#8221; and then switch over to paid service or sell out to big cos (&#8220;yay, exit!!!!11&#8221;) and then dump users, early adopters and others who promoted their services for free, leaving them in the lurch.

STOP. FUCKING. DOING THIS. Argh. I&#8217;ve lost count the number of times and the time I&#8217;ve had to spend in moving shit out of the services.

Don&#8217;t have a business model? Don&#8217;t launch. Don&#8217;t assume giving things for free will work out. It fucking won&#8217;t. Unless you&#8217;ve bazillions in reserve.
