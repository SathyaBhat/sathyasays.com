> Linux kernel: 13 million lines, over 5 patches per hour.
> 
> The latest version of the Linux kernel currently consists of approximately 13 million lines of code across over 33,000 files. The rate of development peaked with version 2.6.30 last year, which saw an average of 6.40 patches per hour. The rate declined to an average of 5.30 patches per hour in version 2.6.35.
> 
> Between version 2.6.30 and 2.6.35, approximately 19 percent of kernel development was done by independent contributors with no corporate affiliation. The undisputed top corporate contributor is Red Hat, whose employees are responsible for 12 percent of the kernel changes that were made between .30 and .35. The next most prolific corporate contributors during that time period are Intel with 7.8 percent, Novell with 5 percent, and IBM with 4.8 percent.
> 
> Google&#8217;s contributions account for 0.7 percent of the changes made to the kernel between .30 and .35. By comparison, Nokia&#8217;s contributions represent 2.3 percent of the changes during the same period. Texas Instruments contributed 1.5 percent and Samsung contributed 0.6 percent.
