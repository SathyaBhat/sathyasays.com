It&#8217;s been about 1 and half years since I started blogging on [Linux][1]. I started Sathya Says as a [WordPress hosted blog][2], and soon shifted to [**my own domain**][3]. It&#8217;s been more than a year now, since I&#8217;ve been shifted away from WordPress hosted blog, and ever since the inception, the theme of my blog has remained the same. Recently while having a look at my blog, I decided to change the theme a bit. After searching for a bit, I decided to have this(WP-Premium) as the theme for Sathya Says.

Coming to the posts, I realize that I haven&#8217;t been posting as often as I should, unfortunately my tight work schedule leaves me with very little time [excuses, excuses I know], I certainly will try my best to keep them posts coming.

Do drop a comment if you wish to say something, or want to leave me a word of encouragement [ that helps :) ], or have any suggestion.

Cheers!
