I&#8217;ve shifted!This time, not just physically but on the web as well.First, physically(literally, and I&#8217;m using too many rhyming words). As a trainee in [3i-Infotech][1] I&#8217;ve shifted from coastal town of Mangalore to the metro, Chennai, which is again a coastal city, just on the the eastern side of India.

On the web, I&#8217;ve shifted from WordPress hosted blog to my very own domain(yippee!!!) hosted on [ExperTrio][2] (thanks, [Preshit][3]!). And for the moment, my Linux experimentations have ceased due to lack of a PC/laptop with me. Updates will continue, as soon as I get them.

And oh yeah, my sis gave birth to a girl. Here&#8217;s a pic of my niece, who&#8217;s been named Saanvi!
