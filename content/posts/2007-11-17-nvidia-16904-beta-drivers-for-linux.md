  * Improved modesetting support on Quadro/GeForce 8 series GPUs.
  * Fixed stability problems with some GeForce 8 series GPUs.
  * Fixed stability problems with some GeForce 6200/7200/7300 GPUs multi-core/SMP systems.
  * Improved hotkey switching support for some Lenovo notebooks.

  * Fixed rendering corruption in Maya&#8217;s Graph Editor.
  * Improved interaction between SLI AFR and swap groups on certain Quadro FX GPUs.
  * Fixed a bug that caused corruption with redirected XV on GPUs without TurboCache support.
  * Improved display device detection on GeForce 8 series GPUs.
  * Improved usability of NVIDIA-settings at lower resolutions like 1024&#215;768 and 800&#215;600.
  * Improved GLX visual consolidation when using Xinerama with Quadro/GeForce 8 series and older GPUs.
