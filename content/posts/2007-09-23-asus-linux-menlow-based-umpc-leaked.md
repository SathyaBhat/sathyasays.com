Leaked shots have finally appeared late in the week of Asus&#8217; heavily anticipated Linux based &#8216;ultra mobile PC&#8217;: the R3. Eagle-eyed snappers at Navigadget spotted it during an Adobe presentation for its AIR platform and we learnt the briefest of spec outlines.
  
At its core will be the much Intel&#8217;s much coveted next gen <a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/mobile-devices/news/2007/09/20/Unleashing-the-Internet-Experience/p1" target="_blank">Menlow</a> platform which is built incorporating the CPU giant&#8217;s 45nm Silverthorne processor and low power chipset meaning performance and battery life gains are in store. An impressive 1,024 x 600 native resolution touchscreen, GPS, a webcam and fingerprint reader also make it inside though everything else remains a mystery.
  
Given that Menlow isn&#8217;t expected until 2008 however we can say that the R3 won&#8217;t be appearing anytime soon, but it certainly looks interesting enough to make Microsoft question whether it has opened Pandora&#8217;s Box&#8230;
