<font size="2">Recently TDT 3D published a <a href="https://www.tdt3d.be/articles_viewer.php?art_id=99"><font color="#555555">comparison of the major 3D digital content creation applications</font></a> such as Maya, 3DS Max, and XSI, and of course Blender. Blender came out surprisingly well, although it definitely still has some weaknesses.</font>

<font size="2">Here&#8217;s what TDT 3D had to say about Blender </font>

<font size="2">&#8220;</font><font size="2">A good all around application<strong> first for freelance</strong>. Blender downside&#8217;s is on</font> <font size="2">interface, who is not today &#8220;industries&#8221; common (no drag & drop, poor intuitive tools,&#8230;) and structured / centralised documentations, </font>**<font size="2">so it&#8217;s the best free all arround solution.&#8221;</font>**
