If you don&#8217;t, well, simply put &#8211; you won&#8217;t be able to effectively use it. Getting a solid knowledge of how a transaction is done, what locking and concurrency controls are and how they work, how the database makes the data durable on disk (redo, undo management) &#8211; all of it is key to effectively using the database.
