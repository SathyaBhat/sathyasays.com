In a surprise move, Red Hat said Thursday that Matthew Szulik is as president and chief executive on January 1, to be replaced by James Whitehurst, 40, Delta Air Lines&#8217; former chief operating officer.

Szulik, who took over as CEO from Bob Young in 1999 just a few months after its initial public offering, said he&#8217;s stepping down because of family health issues.

&#8220;For the last nine months, I&#8217;ve struggled with health issues in my family,&#8221; and that priority couldn&#8217;t be balanced with work, Szulik said in an interview. &#8220;This job requires a 7&#215;24, 110 percent commitment.&#8221;

Szulik, who remains chairman of the board, praised Whitehurst in a statement, saying he&#8217;s a &#8220;hands-on guy who will be a strong cultural fit at Red Hat&#8221; and &#8220;a talented executive who has successfully led a global technology-focused organization at Delta.&#8221;

On a conference call, Szulik said Whitehurst stood &#8220;head and shoulders&#8221; above other candidates interviewed in a recruiting process. He was a programmer earlier in his career and runs four versions of Linux at home, he said.
