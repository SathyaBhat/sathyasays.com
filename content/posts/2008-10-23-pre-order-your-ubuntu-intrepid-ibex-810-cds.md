With just few days ago to Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex) ShipIt &#8211; Canonical&#8217;s service of sending Ubuntu CDs FREE of cost to your doorstop has now started accepting pre-orders for delivery requests of Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex (Ubuntu 8.10). You can order either the Desktop edition or the server edition, and it will be delivered FREE of cost to you(yes, you don&#8217;t even have to pay for shipping).
  
![Preorder Ubuntu][1]

Although Canonical states delivery can take upto 10 weeks &#8211; I&#8217;ve generally received them here in India with 3 weeks. Although the default request is that of a single CD, by placing a <a href="https://shipit.ubuntu.com/specialrequest" target="_blank">special request</a>, you can order any number of CDs &#8211; though I suggest against this &#8211; instead, <a href="https://shipit.ubuntu.com/myrequest" target="_blank">order a single CD</a>, and make copies of it yourself and distribute it!
