After few months of server downtime, [Ubuntu Live Stats][1] is operational again! The main idea behind this project is to reflect the enormous activity Ubuntu has on all fronts. Simply put, Ubuntu Live Stats gathers data from every source they think is interesting &#8211; ie, from forum, both English as well as other languages, bugs from Launchpad, ideas from Brainstorm, new and also security updates and updated packages, all combined into a single website. You can customize the view, choose which sources you want the data from amongst others.
  
The site claims that they&#8217;re still in Beta, and as usual, bugs can be reported to Launchpad. Must visit site for every Ubuntu user.
