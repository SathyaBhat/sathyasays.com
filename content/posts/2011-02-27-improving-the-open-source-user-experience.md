> Designers are scared of developers. Developers speak a foreign language, they are like aliens. Developers don’t package their source code in .zip files, instead we use some scary thing called version control. The frontends typically presuposes a pretty extensive knowledge of the backend, a knowledge the designers simply don’t have and will have a pretty tough time getting. Designers don’t know how to modify a QT GUI, although they may have a daunting idea on how the interface could be so much better.
