Unless you have been living under a stone, you should be knowing that Compiz Fusion transforms your Linux 2D desktop, with virtual desktops into a 3D one, complete with Cube plugin(amongst others) which transforms the virtual desktops into a cube.

Developer Dennis Kasprzyk has finally [finished his idea][1] to implement a cylinder deformation for the cube plugin. The result is that Cubereflex plugin has now been rename to Cubeaddon, and it comes with a new effect, &#8220;CYLINDER&#8221;. Here&#8217;s a screen shot of the plugin in action

For those who wish to see it in action, [here][3] is a YouTube video of it.

To get this effect, you&#8217;ll have to Install Compiz Fusion from git.
  
**Please note that  is not recommended unless you want the absolute bleeding-edge version**.
  
As Compiz Fusion Wiki states,

> Because Git is divided into many different repositories, you can use a script to download and build all the components for you. You can check these out by using:
> 
> `git clone git://git.compiz-fusion.org/users/kristian/compiz-scripts<br />
git clone git://anongit.compiz-fusion.org/fusion/misc/yags`
> 
> The &#8216;get-git&#8217; script will clone and update all Compiz Fusion related modules such as libcompizconfig, compiz and emerald and the &#8216;YAGS&#8217; script will clone all plugin repositories. Using yags is fairly simple, just execute &#8216;./yags $COMMAND&#8217; where $COMMAND can be &#8216;pull&#8217; &#8216;make&#8217; &#8216;make install&#8217; &#8216;make clean&#8217; &#8216;clone&#8217;. YAGS will then apply this command to all applicable directories.

For Ubuntu users, Ubuntu Forums has a dedicated thread to installing Compiz Fusion from git, have a look at it over [here][4].
