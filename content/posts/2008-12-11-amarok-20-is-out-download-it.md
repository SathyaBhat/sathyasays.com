After couple of years of development, Amarok 2 finally hit the release mark, yup Amarok 2.0 was officially <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/en/releases/2.0" target="_blank">released today</a>.

Amarok 2.0 has received [a total overhaul][1], with complete <a href="http://sathyasays.com/tag/kde4" target="_blank">KDE4</a> integration, including use of KDE4 foundations like Phonon, & Plasma. Also a major change with Amarok 2, the use of MySQL as the sole backend database choice. Amarok 2.0 also has a redesigned interface, with them dropping the &#8220;Excel&#8221; style playlist. I&#8217;ve been using Amarok 2.0 since its second beta and have found it really good. One of the striking features of Amarok 2.0 is that the &#8220;Suggested songs&#8221; feature, which had to be enabled manually before, is now eabled by default. Suggested songs basically retrieves songs similar to what you&#8217;re playing right now, from last.fm and then automatically queues the songs available on your local hard drive.

Amarok 2 isn&#8217;t quite complete though, some of the glaring shortcomings include lack of support for an equalizer, and no queuing facility available yet. Visualization support is missing &#8211; though visualizer is not something which I use at all, so this doesn&#8217;t bother me much. The OSD is as of now, not customizable at all. There aren&#8217;t any useful scripts, to add to the problems, Amarok 1.4&#8217;s scripts cannot be used with Amarok 2.0. Despite these Amarok 2.0 is pretty awesome, it shouldn&#8217;t be too longÂ  before we see <a href="http://sathyasays.com/2008/08/03/some-really-cool-and-must-have-amarok-scripts/" target="_blank">some excellent scripts for Amarok</a> 2.0.
