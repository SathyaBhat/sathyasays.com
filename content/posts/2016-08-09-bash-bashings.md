Since <a href="http://sathyabh.at/2016/07/12/in-with-the-new-job/" target="_blank">my new job</a> involves lot more of Linux, shell scripting bash and automation, I&#8217;ve been trying to brush up my Linux skills. Ran into this &#8220;problem&#8221; today where there&#8217;s an init script which handles unicorn start/stop/reload and we were debugging some kinks around this. The init script had a chain of cd to the directory and the unicorn invoke script. Was trying to figure out why unicorn wasn&#8217;t starting up, till I read a bit more and dropped to using echo to understand what&#8217;s happening



This should give an idea. After experimenting with eval, pushd/popd, bash subroutines and some more things, both the Tech Architect and me did a facepalm when we realized&#8230; the script does a cd at start we really didn&#8217;t need that chaining.
