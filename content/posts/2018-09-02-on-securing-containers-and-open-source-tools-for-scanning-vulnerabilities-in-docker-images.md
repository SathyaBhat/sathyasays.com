 I recently published couple of articles elsewhere: 

- How to Increase Container Security and Ward Off Threats - [Adobe Tech Blog](https://medium.com/adobetech/how-to-increase-container-security-and-ward-off-threats-a80d17ef2c0b)
- 5 OpenSource tools for container security - [OpenSource.com](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/tools-container-security)
- Scanning Docker Images for Vulnerabilities with Aqua Microscanner - previously, [on my blog](https://sathyasays.com/2018/05/28/scanning-docker-image-for-vulnerabilities-with-aqua-microscanner/)

Do give them a read.
