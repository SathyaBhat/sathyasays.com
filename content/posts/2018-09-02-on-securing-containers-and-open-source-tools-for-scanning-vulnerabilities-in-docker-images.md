    </li>
  </ul>
</li> The former was adapted from a talk I gave at 

<a href="https://www.containerconf.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Container Conference India</a>, the latter was glance at the open source container/Docker image scanning landscape. I plan to take a deeper look at <a href="https://anchore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anchore</a>, <a href="https://github.com/coreos/clair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GVisor</a>, <a href="https://katacontainers.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kata Containers</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/notary/getting_started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker Notify</a> soon. Stay tuned!
