As we close in on the 7.10 release, today we take a look at NTFS writing, the ability for our Ubuntu machines to write to NTFS formatted partitions, primarily those of Windows XP and Vista.

**But couldn’t I do this in previous versions of Ubuntu?**

Nope! What you could do was see your Windows NTFS drives but not write to them. This is useful for getting data off the computer, for such things as the awesome Migration Assistant but not much use to those who use both OSes on a regular basis.

**So how I use it?**

Install Ubuntu. One your desktop there should a little icon labelled something like “sda1”. Open it up just like any other folder and drag your files to it. Take a look:

Now, having said that, have some care when you are deleting stuff. You can easily delete a system critical file, as you have permissions to everything on the drive.

See you tomorrow, for one last edition of 10 Rocking Features in 10 Days!
