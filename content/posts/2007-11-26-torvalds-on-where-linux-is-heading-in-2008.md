In an interview with the IT news magazine, [InformationWeek][1] Linus Torvalds speaks on where Linux is heading in 2008. He says that he is very gung-ho about solid-state drives, expects progress in graphics and wireless networking, and says the operating system is strong in virtualization despite his personal lack of interest in the area.

Here&#8217;s an excerpt of the interview:

**<font color="#0f4692"><em>InformationWeek</em>:</font>** Is Linux kernel development proceeding faster than Windows Server development?

**<font color="#cc0000">Torvalds:</font>** I&#8217;m the wrong person to ask, for multiple reasons. First off, I&#8217;m somewhat biased, of course. But the other reason is that I don&#8217;t even know &#8212; or really care &#8212; how Windows Server development actually proceeds, so how could I even compare and make an intelligent point?

I simply don&#8217;t use Microsoft products, not because I hate them, but because they aren&#8217;t interesting to me.

**<font color="#0f4692"><em>InformationWeek</em>:</font>** In your opinion, where does Linux shine versus Windows? Reliability? Virtualization?

**<font color="#cc0000">Torvalds:</font>** I think the real strength of Linux is not in any particular area, but in the flexibility. For example, you mention virtualization, and in some ways that&#8217;s a really excellent example, because it&#8217;s not only an example of something where Linux is a fairly strong player, but more tellingly, it&#8217;s an example where there are actually many different approaches, and there is no one-size-fits-all &#8220;One True Virtualization&#8221; model.

 <span id="articleBody"><strong><font color="#0f4692"><em>InformationWeek</em>:</font></strong> Do you think there is any way Microsoft patent holders, or lawyers can take direct aim at the kernel development process and impede it?</p> 

<p>
  <strong><font color="#cc0000">Torvalds:</font></strong> I really don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t think they can impede the technology, and I really don&#8217;t think there is anything real behind that whole intellectual property FUD machine. But nearly infinite amounts of money certainly goes a long way.
