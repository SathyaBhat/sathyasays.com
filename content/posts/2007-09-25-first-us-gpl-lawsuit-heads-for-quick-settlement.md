<font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3">The first U.S. GPL-related lawsuit appears to be headed for a quick out-of-court settlement. Monsoon Multimedia admitted today that it had violated the GPLv2 (GNU General Public License version 2), and said it will release its modified BusyBox code in full compliance with the license.</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3"><a href="https://monsoonmultimedia.com/" target="new">Monsoon Multimedia</a> has stated that it is currently in settlement negotiations with the <a href="https://www.busybox.net/" target="new">BusyBox</a> project to resolve the matter without going to court. The company also said in a statement that it intends to fully comply with all open-source software license requirements. The company plans to make its modified BusyBox source code publicly available on on its website in the coming weeks, it said.</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3">This matter came to the public attention when the SFLC (<a href="https://www.softwarefreedom.org/" target="new">Software Freedom Law Center</a>) announced on Sept. 20 that it had just filed the <a href="https://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS3973290690.html" target="new">first-ever U.S. copyright infringement lawsuit</a> based on a violation of the GPL on behalf of its clients, BusyBox&#8217;s two principal developers. GPLv2-licensed BusyBox is a small-footprint application that implements a lightweight set of standard Unix utilities. It is commonly used in embedded systems.</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3">Monsoon makes consumer devices primarily for home multimedia users. Its line includes such products as <a href="https://linuxdevices.com/news/NS2535349507.html" target="new">Hava, a place- and time-shifting TV recorder</a>. This is an embedded Linux device that&#8217;s similar to the Slingbox. The company also offers SnappySoft, Windows Media Center video capture software.</font>
