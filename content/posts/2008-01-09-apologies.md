Dear Readers,
  
If you&#8217;re one of the few people who&#8217;ve been following and reading my articles, first up, thanks for visiting my sbblog.
  
Secondly, I would like to apologise for lack of updates on my blog from my end. I know I was supposed to cover the Run down to KDE 4.0 release, but since past 2 weeks I&#8217;ve been extremely busy, caught up with work. I will try to keep my blog updated whenever I can, which won&#8217;t be for another week or so. If you&#8217;d like to contribute with Linux tips, articles, or any how-tos, drop me a mail at sathya <at> sathyasays <dot> com or post a message on the [forums][1]

If you&#8217;re still reading this, Many thanks :)

And as a side note, I will also be blogging on my life over at [My World][2]

Thanks & Keep visiting,
  
Sathya
