Sun Microsystems is on a major Open Source Acquistion spree. First it was it&#8217;s MySQL acquisition, now it&#8217;s moved on to acquire innotek. For those who&#8217;re still wondering who or what innotek is, innotek is the developer of the hugely popular Virtualizer, VirtualBox.

According to Sun&#8217;s [Press Release][1]

> Sun Microsystems, Inc. today announced that it has entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire innotek, the provider of the leading edge, open source virtualization software called VirtualBox. By enabling developers to more efficiently build, test and run applications on multiple platforms, VirtualBox will extend the Sun xVM platform onto the desktop and strengthen Sun&#8217;s leadership in the virtualization market. This software is available for all major operating systems at [www.virtualbox.org][2] and [www.openxvm.org][3].**Â ** 
> 
> &#8220;VirtualBox provides Sun with the perfect complement to our recently announced Sun xVM Server product,&#8221; said Rich Green, executive vice president, Sun Software. &#8220;Where Sun xVM Server is designed to enable dynamic IT at the heart of the datacenter, VirtualBox is ideal for any laptop or desktop environment and will align perfectly with Sun&#8217;s other developer focused assets such as GlassFish, OpenSolaris, OpenJDK and soon MySQL as well as a wide range of community open source projects, enabling developers to quickly develop, test and deploy the next generation of applications.&#8221;

So what will be the future of VirtualBox? Can we see some innovations in VirtualBox? Let&#8217;s hope so.
