This could be a very useful post for people who search about and want the  new Intrepid Ibex and its NewHuman theme. There are many clones of the theme available all over the internet in websites like [gnome-look.org][1]. However there is also a way to get the original theme through the repositories.

Let&#8217;s see how we can go about doing the same.
  
<!--more-->

1.   Please add the following repositories and reload/update the repositories, by opening the terminal and typing the following
  
`deb https://ppa.launchpad.net/kwwii/ubuntu hardy main<br />
deb-src https://ppa.launchpad.net/kwwii/ubuntu hardy main<br />
` 

2. Now install the packages gtk2-engines-murrine, human-theme and
  
ubuntu-artwork

3.Optionally, you may restart X server. Then, please go to System -> Preferences->
  
Appearance or right click on the empty desktop and select &#8220;Change Desktop Background&#8221;
  
and go to Theme tab.

4. Either way you will find the NewHuman theme there. Click on it and enjoy.

5. For a nice wallpaper matching to this theme go [here][2].

6. For the login screen can try [this][3] or [this][4]. EDIT: A new list login has also been released <a href="https://gnome-look.org/content/download.php?content=87580&id=1&tan=14172264" target="_blank">here</a>.
