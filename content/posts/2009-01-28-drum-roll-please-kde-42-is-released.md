After nearly a year, the fantastic guys developing KDE have released the much anticipated KDE 4.2 version. The 4.2 version comes after about a year after a (disastrous) KDE 4.0 release. Linus might&#8217;ve switched to Gnome [no link bait here, go Digg it if need the info] but I&#8217;m still hooked on to KDE and especially love the KDE 4 series. KDE 4.1.3 was pretty awesome, and I can&#8217;t wait to try out it out, but the official Sabayon repositories don&#8217;t have KDE 4.2 yet.

You can install the RC version from Naendo repo, I recommend that you wait for the packages to be available in repos.

Can&#8217;t wait to upgrade to it.

(and yes,Â  yes, I \_will\_ post a review on Sabayon soon. so far: its been the distro with the best Out of the Box experience. More soon!)
