### Introducing Ubuntu Mobile &#8211; full Internet, no compromise

Ubuntu Mobile is an Ubuntu edition that targets an exciting new class of computers called Mobile Internet Devices.
  
Ubuntu Mobile, based on the world&#8217;s most popular Linux distribution, and MID hardware from OEMs and ODMs, are redefining what can be done in mobile computing.

Ubuntu Mobile, a fully open source project, gives full Internet, with no compromise. Custom options may include licensed codecs and popular third-party applications.

  * Full Web 2.0/AJAX fidelity, with custom options of Adobe Flash®, Java, and more
  * Outstanding media playback so you can enjoy videos, music and photos with superior quality and easy navigation
  * A suite of applications that work seamlessly to meet every need of a digital parent, student or anyone who is on-the-go
  * Facebook®, MySpace®, YouTube®, Dailymotion®, 3D games, GPS, maps, in short, the full Web 2.0 experience delivered into your hands as a compact and powerful device that&#8217;s easy and fun to use

The product of Canonical collaboration with Intel® and the open source community, Ubuntu Mobile is the software that makes it all possible.

### Just the right stuff

Just the right applications provide an uncompromised Web 2.0 experience: Web browsing, email, media, camera, VoIP, instant messaging, GPS, blogging, digital TV, games, contacts, dates/calendar, simple software updates&#8230; and lots more.

All unnecessary complexity in the user experience is eliminated.

### Finger friendly, touch driven

Ubuntu Mobile is finger friendly, with no stylus needed. You drive Ubuntu Mobile with touch. Simply tap the screen or drag a finger to make gestures for intuitive navigation and control.

  * Tap an application with your finger to launch it, and tap menus and buttons to use them.
  * Swipe a web page to pan up, down or sideways.
  * Swipe a video, photo, song or thumbnail page to move to the next or the previous one.

### Leveraging the MID

MIDs typically have the following features and attributes:

  * Small size/form factor
  * 4 to 7 inch touch screen
  * Physical and/or virtual keyboard
  * Wi-Fi, 3G, Bluetooth, GPS, WiMAX
  * 2GB to 8GB Flash or disk storage, 256MB+ memory/512MB+ recommended

Wow! This can result in a massive change in mentality for people who still think Linux is for geeks. I&#8217;m very impressed by the toouch interface. Do we have something here, which can beat Apple&#8217;s iTouch interface?
