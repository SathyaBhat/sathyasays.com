Mozilla has announced that the next version of Mozilla Firefox, quite possibly one of the best browser out there, Mozilla Firefox 3 will be available for download on June 17. After 34 months of being under development, 5 betas, and 3 Release Candidates, Firefox is ready for release.

Firefox 3 features an extensively revamped location bar, with full search support for history URL and title descriptions, a vastly improved download manager, overhalued bookmark system with support for tags in bookmarks.

For a detailed read on Firefox 3&#8217;s new features you can a look at my Glimpses of Firefox Beta 2 over [here][1] and of Beta 3 over [here][2].
