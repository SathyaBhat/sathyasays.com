About 2 weeks ago, Wakoopa announced that they will be shutting down their <a title="Wakoopa is dead" href="https://techie-buzz.com/tech-news/wakoopa-service-made-software-social-comes-end.html" target="_blank">social network soon</a> & focusing on "Corporate Research".

Unfortunately that day is here. Just received an email stating that as of today, you can grab an <a href="https://social.wakoopa.com/" target="_blank">export of your data</a>.

This is what they have to say about the export

>   The export is a CSV file containing the following columns: application name, subcategory, category, the number of seconds you've used the application in the hour, the hour you've used the application in, the date of the usage, the operating system and your user id.

Too bad Wakoopa's no longer going to be around. Wakoopa would be the first software I'd install - even before installing the drivers. There was something analysing the data about what software you use for how long, and which software did I use the most in the background. Now, I'm not really sure what to do with the data. I don't think Rescue Time supports importing Wakoopa data - it'd be sweet if they did. Maybe see if I can stuff if into <a title="procrastitracker" href="https://procrastitracker.com/" target="_blank">ProcrastiTracker</a>?
